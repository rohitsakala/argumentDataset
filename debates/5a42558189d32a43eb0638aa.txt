 The incidents occurred during the last 50 days, be it the terrorist attack on our air base at Pathankot, be it the incident of suicide by an innocent student in an university and be it the charges of sedition slapped on some students, these incidents well expose the mindset of the Government. We have observed in last two years that an atmosphere of intolerance is being created in the country and all out efforts are being made to stifle the voice dissent. No citizen in the country considers himself as safe in this kind of atmosphere. The whole country is one family and this kind of parochial approach will not be tolerated and we will have to adopt a broad outlook. Our country is like a flower pot where the flowers of all caste, creed and colour blossom fully and their fragrance transcends the whole world and this is uniqueness of our country. I feel compelled to ask a question in this House as to whether following the path of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is sedition. What has been taught to us by Baba Saheb Ambedkar is to educate yourself, organize yourself and raise your voice against unjust and injusitce. On one hand this Government is propagating the values of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and on the other it is committing atrocities on the dalits. This Government is therefore exposing itself gradually. This is the reality today that the students belonging to dalit and minority communities are being discriminated against. The basic aim of university life is to exchange views and to put a challenge to the ad-hocism but this Government intends to put a gag on the students. There cannot be anything more wrong than to malign the name of a university of excellence owing to just 8 students. I would also like to say that this attitude of the Government towards the JNU is just not because of the slogans raised on 9th February. This Government wants to stifle the voice of this institute because the students of JNU had raised the issues of incident occurred at Dadri, the issue relating to reduction in the allocation of budget by the UGC and also the issue relating to the suicide by Rohit Vemula. In fact the youth of our country just ask for little respect.

 The Congress party will have to clear its stand today whether it is with those who kill us or with those who save us. Today, the country owes an answer from them. The grant for JNU has not been slashed for the last one and half year. But the money of the taxpayers cannot be spent on those who instigate students against the country. Today, the taxpayers ask us why their money is being given to those who are insulting our tri-colour and soldiers as well. This cannot be tolerated. They even shouted anti-India slogans like 'struggle until the freedom of Kashmir' and 'struggle till the destruction of India'. If this is termed as the freedom of expression then this is very unfortunate. This cannot be called freedom of expression. Nobody will tolerate anti-national elements who are bent upon breaking our country. I would also like to clarify that there is a difference between the Government of India and India. One can criticize the Government of India and one can also criticize the policies and programmes of our Government but we will not tolerate those who criticize India. In 2010, 76 jawans of CRPF were killed in Dantewada and these very students of Democratic Students Union and other communist student organizations celebrated the killings of these jawans in the JNU campus. Is this called tolerance? You support the ideology of maoists and separatists in JNU. Are you with those traitors or with the patriots. We have never supported maoists. The terrorists are portrayed as martyrs. Kashmir is an integral part of India. But students union of JNU contradicts this. You stand with them. We have come to serve the people. But you are bent on disintegration of India. This saddens us. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The Thorat Committee appointed in 2007 to investigate the growing number of suicides among students in elite educational institutions discovered that of the 23 suicide cases 19 were dalits, two tribals and one Muslim. Instead of assuring social justice to all, the ruling party wishes to use the student unrest in our universities to claim a monopoly on nationalism and tar all of their critics with the brush of "anti-nationalism". But I stand today in support of the right to freedom of expression by young students who may be inspired by Marx as well as Ambedkar. We equivocally condemn slogans and posters incident in Jawaharlal Nehru University. You cannot be a true nationalist if you are opposed to freedom. It is not a crime to seek freedom from caste oppression, freedom from class exploitation, freedom from gender discrimination. History shows us that State-sponsored or State-condoned campaigns against, so called, anti-nationals leads to authoritarian rule and the destruction of democratic principles. We always had different visions of nationhood and it is really a debate and discussion about what should be an ideal form of the Union of India. But nationalism in its narrow form can also be extremely oppressive. The President speaking to us yesterday pointed out that this Government is trying to repeal many obsolete laws. I venture to suggest that the law on sedition is one of them. Free our universities, free our students, let our youth dream a glorious future for our country. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I am not standing up to glorify Afzal Guru. I believe in democracy. I believe that modern human intellect has not, as yet, thrown up any better system of governance than democracy. So, when a scoundrel by the name of Afzal Guru who dares to come and attack this temple which is sacrosanct, there can only be hanging which is the result that we saw. The very system that he wanted to destroy, that system allowed him to breathe for 11 years, 1 month and 11 days after he was nabbed for this dastardly attack. Yet, there are people who glorify a person like Afzal Guru and they are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with those very people who say that we want to break up this country. They have no shame to align themselves and go to the university. In their desperateness to politicize the issue, they lost sight of this critical anti-India movement and they lost track of the greater picture as to how, within a campus, a anti-India movement is being built up, a campus that is funded by the tax-payer of this country. This problem in the JNU could have been handled better. When frauds, dressed as lawyers, attacked students, beat up professors, beat up journalists, the police stood as a mute spectator. Today, that is why because of your mal-intentions, people are questioning your honesty. The Government should welcome criticism. When your faults are thrown up at your face, you have an opportunity to rectify it. You cannot deal with youths of this country by beating them up with goons. You have to deal with them as a civilized society and a civilized Government. I would suggest that the time has come that the Government of the day comes clean and tells the people what the situation is. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I am pained by the incidents which took place in Hyderabad University in Telangana and JNU. There are some organizations like Democratic Students Federation, AISF etc. in the JNU which are involved in these incidents. In the University, a cultural evening was organized for Afzal Guru and anti-India slogans were raised. They supported Maqbool Bhatt. They raised slogans like 'Kashmir struggle will continue till the destruction of India'. Does such slogan not pain us? If some students raise some anti-India slogans in the name of democracy and freedom, should we support them? This issue is being politicized. I do not say that the Opposition should not criticize the Government but if there is an onslaught on the unity of the country all of us should fight against it unitedly. Regarding the JNU incident I would like to make a couple of more points that all these incidents are linked with naxalism. Being Leftist is not wrong but disintegrating the country by being Leftist is unacceptable. Today, JNU has become an outfit for separatists. There is a need to view this issue of separatism in the University seriously. There is also need to repeal Article 370. I request the Government to conduct an inquiry into JNU incident wherein Muslim fundamentalists, terrorists and maoists have mobilised in the University. Such elements should be destroyed before they disintegrate the country. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Jawaharlal Nehru University is a prestigious institution. It has been provided many facilities. Intellectual discussion has been held here for a long. We all should respect the judgment of Supreme Court. A thorough inquiry should be held about the incident happened in JNU but all the student should not be covered under sedition law. All the students of university and all the universities cannot be anti-nationalist. Government should make a statement in this regard to maintain the status of the university. A probe should also be conducted as to whether or not any anti-national slogan was raised there. If any anti-national slogan has been raised there, stern action should be taken. But a detailed inquiry should be conducted in this and if anyone is found guilty, he should not be spared. After all it is our university. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This is most unfortunate incident happened in Hyderabad Central University. We have totally forgotten the issue. Coming to Jawaharlal Nehru University. It is known as the most intellectual hub. There used to be a very healthy debate. For the first time a controversy has arisen. We, being the responsible people, instead of understanding the mentality of the students are unnecessarily invoking sedition Act against them. I think it is too harsh a measure on such an incident. There are economic frauds committed by the people who are embezzling the country's money making India economically weak. Those are the people who need to be invoked sedition clause. Students are like our children. If they are going on a wrong route, we are here to correct them. We cannot do it by punishing them. Our universities are the centres of excellence and we are very proud of all our institutions. There has always been unity in diversity. We, being a tolerant society in India, we love India, we love the unity in diversity. Let us spread the spirit of nationalism. That is why I strongly believe that we should be tolerant for different views expressed by anybody.

 The University of Hyderabad, where the spark called Rohith Vemula got extinguished, is in Chevella, which is my parliamentary constituency. He was boycotted, his scholarship was withheld and he was suspended. The institutions have become insensitive. The behaviour of the Vice Chancellor and the administration now in this Government as well as the VCs in the past Government is same. Regardless of the Government the VCs of Central Universities say they are accountable for nobody except the Ministry in Delhi. I think that has to change. The autonomy of the institution is being destroyed. The appointments to the boards are made without proper feedback. The senior most officers from the VC onwards, they are all elitists and I think they have lost touch with the students. We have heard of many adventure tourisms, but we invented a new thing. It is called 'political tourism'. The hub of political tourism was my constituency. Every party of every kind, especially those who are against the Ruling Party have made it a political tourism destination. This is not the first suicide. There were nine other suicides. Why is this happening now? It is because of political opportunism. I do not want to blame this side of the House or that side of the House. Every once in a while we have to confront these issues. There are various causes and reasons attributed to Rohith Vemula's case - nationalism, casteism, dalit issue, secularism etc. Just as secularism cannot be the patent right of the Congress, nationalism cannot be the patent right of the BJP. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Two incidents have shaken the conscience of the entire nation. One is a suicide of a brilliant student, Rohit Vemula, who belongs to Hyderabad Central University. The second incident is of sending Kanhaiya Kumar the elected President of JNUSU to jail. Rohith Vemula was suspended due to continuous pressure exerted by two Union Ministers. Unable to withstand the pressure that brilliant student ended his life by committing suicide . Hence, I said that this is not merely a suicide, but it is an institutional murder. Now, they are targeting JNU. In just a single week, there were four instance of photo shopping and fabrication of evidences with regard to JNU incident. The first was the so- called tweet which turned out to be a fake tweet, and the Home Minister was quick to believe what the Lashkar-e-Toiba leader has said and he accused them of having terror links. Secondly, there was photo-shopping of a photo of Kanhaiya Kumar with the background of a divided map of India. The National Human Rights Commission told us that a statement was fabricated - the Police forced Kanhaiya Kumar to make a statement. Now, you are accusing all students as anti-nationals. You are creating a divide between 'nationals' and 'anti-nationals'. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This issue is extremely sensitive. But what happned in Hyderabad is altogether a different one. It is based on the caste whereas in JNU it is on the national issue. As many people said Rohith Vemula was literally driven to commit a suicide. He was selected on merit. He comes from a very poor family, a dalit family where his father had deserted his wife, that is, his mother. The Vice Chancellor has a bad history. The second person the Chairman of the Executive Council also had a bad hisotry as far as dalits are concerned. For six months he was not given the JRF fellowship. Students were barred from the library. The mess was closed for them. Hon.Minister says that suspension is a small punishment. Universities have a certain freedom of expression. The students have their rights. Why should the Government react to that? I would request the hon.Minister of HRD to kindly look into the dalits issue in a different manner. I request her to see that a dalit representative is put up on Executive Council where there is none now. The Government should see that at least such things are not repeated. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 All the young MPs in the House should raise voice of youths rather than raising the voice of their party or standing in favour or in opposition to this issue. On one hand, an scholar of Hyderabad university committed suicide after being helpless and dissatisfied with the system and on the other, an esteemed university is engulfed in the controversy on the issue of anti- nationalism and sedtion. Those who are involved in this case are guilty and must face stringent action. The involvement in anti-national activities is not merely distraction but it is an unpardonable crime and such cases should be handled with utmost seriousness. I am sure that if this case had been handled with a bit of sensitivity, the consequence would have been different. If the cause of his suicide relates to his dalit background then I also feel distressed and disenchanted with such mindsets still holding ground in our society. I would, therefore, like to have an assurance from this august House that those who are weakening this country from within should be segregated and marginalized. However, we must ensure that in the process innocents are not punished. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The incident regarding Rohith Vemula which took place in Hyderabad University has been going on in other universities, educational institutions and in society since years and ages. There were two groups of students in Hyderabad Central University. Rohith's research fellowship was stopped. In my view the action regarding JNU was taken in haste due to which the situation deteriorated. Everyone is of the view that the incident which took place in JNU on 9th February is a shameful act. Every Indian will condemn this. The issue which should have been disposed off at the level of vice chancellor has tied the Delhi Police and the Union Home Minister in knots. Regarding the incident of Hyderabad University and the JNU no step should be taken in haste which would affect the future of the students. THE MINISTER OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT, MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND MINISTER OF 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The first point is, what happened in Hyderabad University, Rohith Vemula incident is unfortunate, condemnable and the Government has appointed an Inquiry Committee to get into this entire gambit and come out with its findings. In the Hyderabad University itself so far 12 students have committed suicides and they belonged to weaker sections, poorer sections. This is happening since 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 to 2016. Who is responsible for this? Should the society in general, the academic community and particularly the administration of the Universities not ponder over this issue and come with some conclusion? Then the political leadership of the country are trying to make it a political issue and trying to tar somebody as pro-Dalit and anti-Dalit and score a political point is not good. The main issue is, what the circumstances are which are forcing the students to commit suicide. Secondly, what has happened there also and what sort of slogans were given, that also should be understood. It has nothing to do with Rohit. The Universities are meant for academic excellence. Thirdly, today we are discussing about JNU. Nobody is saying that JNU is anti-national. But definitely certain anti-national activities are happening at the behest of an organisation which is allied with Maoists. But if you try to justify that and then try to connect it to dissent, then you are sending a wrong signal to encourage such tendencies and divisive tendencies among the students. The world wants to invest in India. I would like to say to my friends from Congress to please discuss this quietly and clarify your position also. Some cultural programme goes on and discussion takes place in JNU. We have no problem on that count. The University withdrew the permission because of the issue of Afzal Guru, Maqbool Bhatt, etc. If Afzal Guru had succeeded none of us would have existed that day. The Sessions Court, the High Court, the Division Bench, the Supreme Court after exhaustive long years of trial have decided on this case. What was the slogan given? 'Afzal Guru jo aapne adhura kaam choda hai hum usey pura karenge'. What is that adhura kam? The adhura kam was not being able to blast the Indian Parliament. It is because of the security forces that we are alive here. Any sympathy with people like Afzal Guru or Maqbool Bhat or Yakub Memon and all is nothing but clearly anti-national; nothing but against the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of the country. Can anybody be liberal with such anti-national activities? What happened in Jadavpur? West Bengal is not an independent island. It is part of India. Let us try to stand with the nationalist forces and then see to it that these forces which are trying to weaken India are nipped in the bud. People who are sitting in the studios and making some commentaries sympathizing with Dawood Ibrahim, Afzal Guru, let them see the public opinion. In the on-line survey also, 99 percent is on one side and only one per cent is on the other side. What happened in Patiala Court is totally condemnable. But do not try to divert the attention from the main issue. Please remember the sacrifices made by our jawans by our security forces. Let us confine ourselves to the main issue and then try to speak as one nation as far as anti-national activities are concerned. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In this House, two very sensitive case are being discussed. First is the case regarding Rohith Vemula of Hyderabad and the second is regarding students of JNU. I would like to submit that we are patriots of our country. We have fought in the freedom struggle of our country. There have been some kind of incidents in Jawaharlal Nehru University. The students belong to rural background. They are dalit, are exploited and are poor. JNU is an educational hub. This issue is being diverted in a very tricky way. We require to hurl the national flag in our country. We do not need support in this matter from other people. J.N.U. is an educational University of progressive students. Dr. Ambedkar's 125th Anniversary had been celebrated in our country. Dr. Ambedkar is a symbol of heritage of our country. During his lifetime Dr. Ambedkar said once that I was born in Hinduism, but I would like to die in other religion. Now incidents of atrocity on poor people and dalits have risen. Therefore, the political parties should become alert before it is too late. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Slogans are chanted in JNU, in Srinagar too slogans were chanted. Do you think of closing Srinagar also? Why do you support the PDP party ? It is the PDP that termed Afzal Guru a martyr and his trial a travesty of justice. Why your so called love for India or nationalism does not apply here? I challenge the BJP party to prove the charges against Kanaihya. All charges against Kanaihya are fabricated. No slogan was chanted as per police report. The loss of life of Rohith could be averted, had the HRD Minister taken action on time. During the Congress rule the party used to boast of its liberal ideology. When the BJP is in power it talks about ideology of Veer Savarkar, Golvarkar, Deendayal Upadhyay etc. How long these two parties will go on boasting of their respective ideologies. Where is the custom of India. These parties try to impose their ideology on the tradition of India. I would like to tell the government that it has failed to give justice to dalits because it is anti-dalit. If at all any slogan is chanted that somebody is against Manuism and he is against communal forces there is nothing wrong. So I request you not to impose ideologies on the long cherished tradition of India. We should talk only about Constitution which has given us freedom of expression. Action should be taken against all those news channels who are falsely reporting that anti-India slogans were chanted. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We visited JNU also. This incident is widely criticized inside and outside the country. Everybody is disapproving of the arrest of the student leader. Conflict of ideology goes on continually. Having an opposite ideology can never be termed as anti-India. With regard to Kanhaiya episode I would like to submit only this much that the incident should be thoroughly examined. The action of lawyers should also be investigated. The sedition charge against Kanhaiya should be withdrawn. Freedom of expression of a student should never be challenged. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Police lathicharged the sleeping students of Nekiram College and Jat College of MDU University at Rohtak inside the college campus. As per rule the prior permission of Principal or Proctor is required before entering the college campus. But the incumbent DSP lathicharged the unarmed young students with the help of the police force. The young students in Haryana sustained physical injuries and fractures. But the police did not bother to take them to hospital. I demand judicial inquiry in this regard. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Today, the Rohith issue is widely discussed in JNU and Hyderabad University. With regard to the arrest of the student leader Kanaihya in JNU dispute I would like to ask the government whether it bothered to ascertain the reality before his arrest. Why the sloganeering of unarmed students was not examined before levelling sedition charge against them. Can any citizen not exercise its Right to Expression? If this right is denied isn't it the violation of right enshrined in the Constitution ? The country is proud of the institutions like JNU, but the government is bent upon defaming it. If the criticism of the policy or conduct of the government can be linked with an act of anti-nationalism and is said to be tantamount to sedition, what is the justification of Fundamental Rights of the Constitution? Rohith Vemula belongs to a dalit family. He was compelled to commit suicide in the room of Hostel due to shaky approach of the government. This dalit research scholar had not been given his scholarship for last seven months. He had no money to pay his fee. He was one among those five students of Ambedkar Student's Association who were suspended by the University Administration. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The youth lay down their lives for the sake of the security of the country. But what I have heard today gives massage that their martyrdom is being mocked. The sloganeering at JNU is very harmful for the nation. Time and again it is said that mistake has been made. Mistake can be pardoned, but not conspiracy. Those involved in sloganeering are middle aged persons. They have been living there for nine years. So many anti-national activities are taking place there. I request the government that the entire issue should be looked into. The reality is that those who have ruled here for 60 years, are reluctant to accept that a person belonging to backward caste is our Prime Minister. A humble person who used to be a chaiwala has become the messiah of the poor and the Prime Minister of the nation. These people do not accept this hard fact. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 President of the Jawaharlal Nehru University student union believes in the electoral system. The Maoists do not believe in the electoral system. They say that power grows out of the gun. He is a Member of the Communist Party of India and also a leader of the All India Students Federation. Elections were conducted and he was elected as the President of the Jawaharlal University Student Union. Now, the Government has put him behind bars. The man behind his arrest is a Delhi local MP. He is against him because of his ego. He is not invited to the Jawaharlal Nehru University of discussions, seminars and for inaugurations. President of JNUSU belongs to a poor family. He belongs to the third generation of a family of Communist in Bihar, who had made immense sacrifices not only during Freedom Struggle but also continue to fight for people's rights and to defend democracy, secularism and rule of law. But such a man is, now, behind bars; and he is accused that he is not patriotic. We head in Kerala that somebody is selling patriotism in Delhi. We communists know that is patriotism. The internally reputed Jawaharlal Nehru University has been targeted from the day the BJP Government came to power. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In the 10 years of the UPA regime, lots of cases of suicides came up but at that time, my friends from the Congress party, never raised the issue of caste-based oppression and discrimination in our central universities nor did they, at that point of time, see any such institutional murders, which they are referring to, happening within our central universities. Case-based discrimination and oppression in our central universities is a reality but this has been in existence for a very long time and for much of the period after independence, it is the Congress party, which has ruled over the country. Had they been so serious and sensitive about this issue of caste based oppression and discriminations in our central universities, then they would have really created a mechanism to sensitive our faculty members in the Central Universities to deal with students coming from varied social backgrounds. They would have also created a legislation to protect the students coming from the marginalized sections of the society from all forms of caste based discrimination and also they would have made efforts to fill up the backlog of the SC/ST/OBC vacancies in the faculties so that we see a social diversity in the caste composition of our faculties in the universities. The kind of slogans which were raised in the cultural evening on 9th February within the JNU campus were clearly against India. People here are misinterpreting the fundamental right of freedom to speech and expression. It does not mean that it is an absolute right and we can raise slogans against our nation. We have to really review out definition and understanding of this fundamental right. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The University in the country are really in turmoil, not only in JNU, whether it is Hyderabad Central University or any other university. But who is responsible for this? That is the question. Actually, you have to think about the JNU affair also. JNU is like a volcano. You see, you are saying that the students are anti-nationals. What is the evidence with you? Depending upon some photographs and some reports, you are branding the brilliant students as anti-nationals. It cannot be tolerated. I would like to tell the Government that the Government should desist from doing this kind of things. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We are discussing a very serious and sensitive issue regarding nationalism, patriotism and the unity and integrity of our country. I fully support and endorse the views expressed by the learned colleague in this House. Madam, the two issues, which I would like to highlight, are the Rohith Vemula case and the detention of Kanhaiya Kumar case. These two incidents are manifestations of dissatisfaction and unrest among the people of our country. There is a feeling of insecurity among the people, especially, among the Dalits and Backward Communities of the society as well as there is a feeling of unhappiness and insecurity among the minorities and also among the free liberal, independent thinking and progressive people. Those who are so secular are also having a feeling that there is a threat to the secular fabric of our country. How was the Jadavpur University issue managed by the West Bengal Government ? They beautifully handled it. It did not become a national or international issue. My point is that the Government has to correct and review the policy and the system of governance. SHRI KODIKUNNIL SURESH I would like to remember and honour the sacrifice of Rohith Vemula, a brilliant dalit student, who had fought for his education rights. This coincidence with the 125th birth celebrations of Baba Sahib Ambedkar and is a disappointing incident that dalit and adivasi students are not being considered as an integral part of the nation building. With various budget cuts and non-transfer of scholarships, the exclusionary processes are being followed in the higher education. I am only placing the issues which our dalit students have been facing in the campus. There are many challenges. The economic conditions of majority of SC and ST students being worse, their accessibility to higher education is restricted. Majority of dalit and adivasi students come from rural background and lack necessary social capital, They lack awareness about educational entitlements and government provision. Even if students are aware of the government provisions, there is a systematic denial from colleges, universities, UGC and Ministries to access basic entitlements like scholarships, hostel, student support, fee reimbursement etc. An anti- discrimination monitoring authority named as Equity Committee in each and every education institution of the country with equal representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the body which will be responsible for receiving complaints, holding enquiry and ensuring preventive and protective measures on the complaints of caste and ethnicity based discrimination in educational institutions. THE MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

 Those who lay seize upon my integrity in this Honorable House need to know the following. 66,230 grievances received by my ministry from general public from 01-05-2014 to 23- 02-2016. I have addressed about 61,892 grievances during the said period. On 12-02-2015 a student wrote me that he is not receiving fellowship. I have given a fellowship of more than one lakh rupees to him through my ministry within a month. I also received letters of Member of Parliament, Hanumant Rao ji who is not an MP of my party. He wrote me that there is need of justice in University of Hyderabad. He said that dalit student committed suicide in the tenure of the Vice- Chancellor who was appointed by the Government of Congress. I will not apologize for what duty I performed. Do not go, listen to my reply. You were not interested to listen me, I was doing my duties and you are trying to hang me. Owaisi Ji also wrote to me. I did my duty. The Government of Congress appointed such a person as V.C. who was accused of atrocity against a woman and wanted the justice from the Government of Modi Ji. One student committed suicide and politics is being made over his death. An executive council which ordered to terminate Rohith, no member of the council was appointed by the Government of NDA. Keeping in view that no member was from dalit community in the faculty, a dalit member was co-opted. Chief warden is a dalit. It is unfortunate that the politics was being made over a child. This is a proof of it. The police of the state is able to give justice but no doctor was allowed to go near this child till 6.30 PM because those who were chanting slogans they did not want justice, they only want to politicize the matter. This child in his statement says, no one is responsible for my death. But yet you seek to use this child for your own political ends. People who espoused the cause of free speech and attack this government, who say that we are anti-minority, anti-dalit, anti-tribal. Time and again they have been requested do not make use of this against them. I am not certifying your patriotism but not demean mine. This is the permission slip from JNU which clearly says that Omar Khalid, one student wanted to book the venue from 5 o'clock to 7.30 PM on the 9th. This Committee which has no relation with government issued such a statement. Misrepresentation of proposed event as cultural evening although the objective was to hold a political meeting, forcefully holding the event when the permission to hold was withdrawn, creating a law and order situation on campus and the prima facie Enquiry Committee finds the following individuals to be involved. The individuals who are named by the faculty of JNU are Syed Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Rama Naga, Anant Prakash Narayan, Kanhiya Kumar, Aishwarya Adhikari and Shweta Raj. Considering the seriousness of the offence committee has recommended that the above mentioned students may be academically suspended from JNU with immediate effect. A call to rise against the Supreme Court which you approach for bail now, a call to rise against the President of India to whom you go and implore and say do justice. The people who called them hangmen went to their house and knocked. The person opened the door and welcomed the person. This is democracy. On the 9th night, they transpired on the campus. On the 10th, this is a pamphlet which is stuck all across with these signatures. Pamphlet on the 10th Febuarary highlights what the communist Leaders call Mahisasur martyrdom day. Who wants to have the discussion on the streets of Kolkata, I want to know whether Rahul Gandhi will stand for this freedom. Education should not be made a yardstick for war. I made this request in both the Houses but nobody heard. Any vice- chancellor appointed by Congress, says that I have done saffronization, I would quit from politics. Shri Atal Bihar Vajpayee had said that India is not a piece of land, it is a land of great people. He said that it is a pious land, it is a praiseworthy land and a land of sacrifice. All rivers flowing through this land are pious like Ganga. Even a stone on this land is like God Shankar. We will live and die for this land. Even after death all will hear one voice Hail Mother India. Indira Gandhi had lost power but her son did not talk of anti-national slogans. If we make education a mess of war, it will treat children as vote bank, what message will be given to erring students of JNU, but politics brought ruin to the country. Listen to children for they come with their emotional legacies and their social challenges and it is incumbent upon us to provide them refuge and a productive life. My request is help me build this nation and not destroy it from within.

 Our colleague has delivered her speech after listening Hon.Member's views in the House. Her speech is commendable. I think it is a eye opening speech for whole the country. I would like to say about Jawahar Lal Nehru University that it is one of the best educational Institutes in the country. I agree that it is a centre of excellence. Our government never thought that Jawahar Lal Nehru University can be a centre of anti- national activities. As far as students are concerned, they are the fund of any universities or educational institutions. Student's life is revolutionary. If this is a fight against atrocity, I think that it is freedom of expression. Nobody should have any objection, but freedom of speech needs limit. If anyone cross their limits, no awakened society will pardon at any cost. There is nothing interfering in the matter of JNU whatever happened therein and whatever action being taken by the police. Charges of sedition should be framed or not, it is a matter of discussion. I think that there is no justification of discussion in this regard. I want to give an assurance that police will not be allowed to harass any innocent student. Police has taken action in the matter of Patiala House. Guilty persons will not be spared. I only want to say that the whole nation is against the slogans chanted in JNU campus on 9th February, 2016. The whole case is prejudiced and we should wait for the verdict of the court. I want to make it clear that I speak only on the basis of direct and indirect facts. I never speak baseless things. The discussion was concluded.
