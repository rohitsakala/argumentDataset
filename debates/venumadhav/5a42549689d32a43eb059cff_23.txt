 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill.

 We disapprove of this Bill as our problem is with the way in which this Government has implemented it. Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed the GST when the Opposition was not present in the Assembly. The Opposition claimed that this was a violation of Jammu & Kashmir Constitution and of Article 370 because it eroded the State's special status in terms of its own financial autonomy and its legislative powers which are reserved for the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. By impinging upon the power of the State to impose taxes, the Government is violating the fundamental power of that Government. By extending GST to Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre gains effective control of the taxation in the State. That was, of course, something which was reserved by the Constitution for the State Government. The State has been dealing with conflict for a long time and we must absolutely not do anything that might harm its stability. GST tax rates are far more complicated than it needs to be. This is the Minister who told us that he was opposed to tax terrorism, instead what we are seeing is tax form terrorism. We are seeing something which obviously is going to cause a whole amount of problems, increasing works for everybody involved in business. There is a particular problem when it relates to Jammu and Kashmir. Its principle revenue generation is tourism which has been affected by terrorism. The 28 per cent GST now is going to affect all of the tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. If this is not rolled back, it is likely to make Kashmir uncompetitive in tourism. My State, Kerala has become uncompetitive in tourism because the tax rate is driving up the cost beyond any of our neighbouring States. GST has been applied at the rate of 12 per cent on highway construction which is going to come to a halt. I do want to stress finally that there is also a great threat of litigation coming up about which tax brackets, which companies fall into and how their goods should be categorised. The Government has raised the cost of many goods for GST. The current Government version of GST, I am sorry, would have a negative effect on GDP instead of a positive one and it would actually fulfil the warning of the National Institute of Public Policy. The Parliament today must contemplate the impact of GST on the Centre's relation with J&K before we make the major mistake of passing this Bill without adequate consultation with the stakeholders.
