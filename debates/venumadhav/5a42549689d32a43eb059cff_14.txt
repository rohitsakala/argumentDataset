 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised.

 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this.
