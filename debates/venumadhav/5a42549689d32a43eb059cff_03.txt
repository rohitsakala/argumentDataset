 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

 We disapprove of this Bill as our problem is with the way in which this Government has implemented it. Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed the GST when the Opposition was not present in the Assembly. The Opposition claimed that this was a violation of Jammu & Kashmir Constitution and of Article 370 because it eroded the State's special status in terms of its own financial autonomy and its legislative powers which are reserved for the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. By impinging upon the power of the State to impose taxes, the Government is violating the fundamental power of that Government. By extending GST to Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre gains effective control of the taxation in the State. That was, of course, something which was reserved by the Constitution for the State Government. The State has been dealing with conflict for a long time and we must absolutely not do anything that might harm its stability. GST tax rates are far more complicated than it needs to be. This is the Minister who told us that he was opposed to tax terrorism, instead what we are seeing is tax form terrorism. We are seeing something which obviously is going to cause a whole amount of problems, increasing works for everybody involved in business. There is a particular problem when it relates to Jammu and Kashmir. Its principle revenue generation is tourism which has been affected by terrorism. The 28 per cent GST now is going to affect all of the tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. If this is not rolled back, it is likely to make Kashmir uncompetitive in tourism. My State, Kerala has become uncompetitive in tourism because the tax rate is driving up the cost beyond any of our neighbouring States. GST has been applied at the rate of 12 per cent on highway construction which is going to come to a halt. I do want to stress finally that there is also a great threat of litigation coming up about which tax brackets, which companies fall into and how their goods should be categorised. The Government has raised the cost of many goods for GST. The current Government version of GST, I am sorry, would have a negative effect on GDP instead of a positive one and it would actually fulfil the warning of the National Institute of Public Policy. The Parliament today must contemplate the impact of GST on the Centre's relation with J&K before we make the major mistake of passing this Bill without adequate consultation with the stakeholders.
