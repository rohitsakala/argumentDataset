 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++It is a very straightforward and simple bill. Hon.Prime Minister had a dream of 'one nation, one tax'. There were many efforts in this direction. Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of all States were called. All were made aware of the importance of GST. When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir, we can understand why it was not implemented there at the same time. It was not possible because of Article 370 of the Constitution. BJP is a partner in Jammu and Kashmir Government. Why is there delay even then? We spend lakhs and crores of rupees from the consolidated fund of India in protecting Jammu and Kashmir. We provide special package. We faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. In reality, we were victorious but a part of Kashmir is still occupied by Pakistan. Pak-occupied Kashmir means our land occupied by Pakistan and terrorist camps have come up there. Terrorism is affecting us for years. We are proud of the surgical strike by our forces. We were shown the video in the Home Ministry in which our Jawans crossed the border and destroyed more than 40 terrorist camps within 12 hours. On the other hand, there is China. This is a majority government hence, Article 370 of the Constitution should be abolished. It is important to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir as well, so we are supporting this Bill.
