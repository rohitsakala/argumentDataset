This Bill has been passed by Rajya Sabha after exhaustive deliberations. First of all, the Standing Committee held wide consultations with all the stakeholders, development partners, all the persons associated with this sector and the persons tested HIV positive. In addition to inter-ministerial consultation, the state representatives were also consulted on the subject. Total 29 inter-ministerial consultations and 21 departmental consultations were held. The Standing Committee made 11 recommendations in this regard and 10 recommendations out of them have been incorporated in the Bill. Today, this Bill has been brought in Lok Sabha. This Bill not only strengthens those persons who are committed to tackle the HIV virus but also provide them powers as well as legal protection to tide over this crisis. With the passage of this Bill, a legal protection will be available to them and the persons violating the legal provisions will be punished with fine and imprisonment. Criminal and civil action will also be initiated against them. Most importantly, HIV patients will not have to face any kind of discriminations following the passage of this Bill. Secondly, action will be taken against those who discriminate against HIV patients. This Bill seeks to create conductive atmosphere for HIV positive persons at their work places and in the society. Treating them with disgust or preventing them from working in any institution will constitute an offence under the law. But this Bill intends to put the discriminatory treatment to an end. Similarly, we will provide protection to the persons working in healthcare institutions by invariably providing gloves, safe needles and safe environment to them. Besides, the Government will promote the measures intended to check the spread of HIV virus. We will have to adopt holistic and aggressive strategy for that purpose and it will be incumbent upon the Government to adopt such a strategy from time to time. Thus, this Bill protects the interests of the HIV infected persons. We will have to be cautious, lest the child should not get infected with HIV virus if a mother is HIV positive. At the same time, the rights of the HIV positive persons to property and their other rights will also be legally protected. It has also been provided that there will be a complaint registration officer on every 25 employees in healthcare institutions. A penalty of Rs.1 lakh or imprisonment or both have been provided for violating these provisions. Moreover, states ombudsmen will be appointed by the state governments. If an injustice is done to a patient, the ombudsman will decide as to who has done the injustice and will take action within 30 days in this respect. Apart from this, confidentiality of the HIV infected patients will be maintained in the proceedings of the courts and in the medical records. I, through you, would like to say to all the hon.Members that this Bill is people-centric and progressive one and hence I request them to pass the Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Government claims that it is an exhaustive, aggressive and progressive legislation. But there may be inexhaustive suggestions and there may be inexhaustive promises and demands which also should be taken note of. Decades have passed when we are still undergoing the HIV and AIDS epidemic and still profound stigma and discriminations are attached with the lives of those suffering from this disease. So, first of all, my suggestion to the Government is that mass awareness is the need of the hour. Without comprehensive mass awareness programme, Government would not be able to get the common people away from the spectre of the stigma and discrimination. However, most of the recommendations of the Standing Committee have been accommodated in this legislation. Integration of HIV and AIDS intervention in Primary Healthcare System has taken place in India from 2010 onwards and during 2016, India pledged to follow targets to fast track the pace of progress towards ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat in the next five years, and ending the epidemic by 2030. We are also aware that this Government is pursuing the Sustainable Development Goal whereby it has been committed that by 2030, the AIDS and HIV epidemic will be wiped out. To implement the Sustainable Development Goal, the Government requires funds to the mind-boggling amount of Rs.55 lakh crore. So, I do not know, how the funds will be mobilized by the Government. I would like to know from the Government about its fast-track target and that are the fast-track targets. The Bill misses the Fast-Track target of 2020 about which I would like to be enlightened by the Government. I would also like to know the rate of HIV that has turned into full- blown AIDS in India. The Government should issue a clarion call to each and every Indian that we are striving and we need a vision of zero new HIV infection, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths. India records around 68,000 fatalities every year from Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome and related infections. Whereas the National AIDS Control Organization's budget has been reduced by a whopping 22 per cent which left the State Governments to fend for themselves. There is a controversy over Section 14(1) of this Legislation. The Bill has not addressed the demand for the removal of four-word phrase 'as far as possible' of Clause 14(1) which pertains to the treatment of HIV affected people. The four words 'as far as possible' dilutes the objective with which India's AIDS control programme has worked so far. Therefore, I would urge upon the Government that to dispel the fear of the affected people these four words 'as far as possible' should be deleted from this legislative document. I would like to know from the hon.Minister whether our blood banks in the States are equipped enough to screen the blood which is not tainted with or which is not infected with HIV and AIDS. The 2006 draft of the Bill was comprehensive. It not only protected the rights of PLHIV but also the most-at-risk population. The Bill does not have elements regarding the outlines of policy change, funding and normalisation of HIV plus individuals in society. The Bill has severe drawbacks in terms of fiscal responsibility. The Bill provides for the establishment of only one ombudsman. However, we need more ombudsmen. Again tuberculosis is the leading cause of death for people with HIV worldwide. However, TB can be cured, but I have found nothing in this legislation in regard to my contention about TB.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ever since the formation of this Government, all the laws enacted by this government have been people centric and poor people oriented. Today, this Bill brought by hon.Minister is also a people centric and meant for poor people. This Bill also aims to provide rehabilitation to those affected by the HIV together with ensuring their welfare. In the year, 1986 Dr. Sumit Soloman and his student Dr. Selepan Nirmal first detected the HIV case in Chennai city of Tamil Nadu. Indian doctors are seen with respect all over the world. HIV people are discriminated against, denied admission in schools and are also not provided any facilities including free treatment in the hospitals. I understand that many good provisions have been made in this Bill including the penalty provisions. Almost 90 per cent AIDS patient reside in China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The Government has accepted 10 out of 11 suggestions made by the standing committee. Our government has provided for health for all in the newly declared health policy and this will go a long way in benefitting the AIDS patient. Along with the enactment of laws, participation of people should also be ensured. Otherwise we cannot achieve success in this field. I would request the government that we should rope in our religious leaders in the awareness campaign because a very large number of people follow that. We can do a lot of work in terms of prevention of this disease.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are certain problems associated with HIV infection. The treatment of the disease per se and the combination is very costly. Therefore, the burden lies on the Government and the patient. The third thing is the discrimination against the person affected by the disease. The fourth thing is that the person gets infection not due to his fault but for various other reasons. Two decades ago, India was considered a hotspot. Initially, in States like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, many cases were detected, but all the State Governments, with the help of the Central Government, took all the measures to control the disease. India has demonstrated that the course of an epidemic can be reversed by public education, mass awareness and wide-scale availability of testing and treatment. The present Bill lists the various ground on which discrimination against HIV-affected persons and those living with them is prohibited. I feel this should be executed on the ground-level without any compromise. The Union Government should provide adequate financial and logistic support to the State Governments to take effective measures to prevent further spread of HIV or AIDS. For the first time, the Bill brings together a human rights perspective to public health and makes Antiretroviral treatment a right of HIV/AIDS patients. This Bill will ensure that in future that no Indian has to struggle for diagnosis or treatment. The Bill also mandates that no person can be compelled to disclose their HIV status report except with informed consent, and if required by a court order. The Bill intends to ensure that those living with HIV do so with dignity and respect enjoying all their rights as citizens. DR. RATNA DE (NAG): India has the third largest HIV epidemics in the world after South Africa and Nigeria. The Bill highlights the provisions to safeguard the rights of the people living with HIV and affected by HIV. It also lists various grounds on which discrimination against HIV positive persons and those living with them is prohibited. Alongside, the aim is also to enhance the legal accountability and establish formal mechanism for redressing grievances. The prevention programme does not look at how women's bodies are different from men. The Bill fails to include provisions for the protection of people who are most vulnerable to contracting the disease, for instance, people frequently using contaminated injection equipment. The stigma attached to HIV AIDS victims in India remains intense and is not only confined to social obstacles but economic too. The Chief Minister of West Bengal has initiated a programme called Muktir Alo for skill development and vocational training for the sex workers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I commend the efforts of the Government and the hon.Minister for coming up with this Bill. The Bill seeks to prevent and control the spread of HIV and AIDS, prohibits discrimination against persons with HIV and AIDS, provides confidentiality with regard to their treatment etc. The Bill lists various grounds on which discrimination against HIV positive persons and those living with them is prohibited. The Bill requires that no person shall be compelled to disclose his/her HIV status except with his/her informed consent, and if required, by a court order. District Ganjam in Odisha is known as the top-most HIV and AIDS prone district in the country. There are no sophisticated hospitals to check this fatal disease and no jobs are created in those areas to minimize the migration of labourers. Reports say several patients in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere have refused to take free medicines and other services owing to the fear that linking that AADHAAR number will reveal their identity and expose them. I would request the hon.Minister to give clarity on this aspect as to how the Government intends to deal with this situation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On behalf of Telugu Desam Party, we wholeheartedly support this Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing forward a lot of historical Bills like the ones on Mental Healthcare etc. Before AIDS there is another condition which is called HIV positive. Once a person is tested HIV Positive, for him to develop AIDS it may take 10 years to 20 years and in some cases he may not even get AIDS. Most of the patients of AIDS suffer from chronic malnutrition and under nutrition. Most of the symptoms and signs of AIDS just mimic tuberculosis. A big debate is going on whether AIDS is a separate disorder as district from tuberculosis or it has only to do with the Sexually Transmitted Diseases. If that is so, let us call it Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Why do we label it separately as AIDS and make the patients suffer from stigma. I definitely support this Bill which has excellent provisions.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the outset, let me say that we fully support the Bill and I also congratulate the hon.Health Minister who has brought this Bill which was pending for a long time. I also take this opportunity to thank him on behalf of my Government for allotting the AIIMS to Telangana State. I would also urge upon the Government to give financial sanction for the AIIMS in this budget only. AIDS affects the body, the mind and the social status. Most of the patients are from the lower and middle income groups. They are made to run from one hospital to another. Various excuses and reasons are given not to give treatment. This Bill will effectively deal with it as it has punishment provisions for people who avoid rendering services for these people. That is the most important aspect of this Bill which I wholeheartedly welcome. Every master health checkup has a HIV test. Every diagnostic centre and hospital should take the precaution that people who come for routine and regular health check up also need to be informed about all the tests. Most of the times we see social tensions and violence after the marriage. I am finding fault with those who know about HIV but do not disclose it to the family of the innocent girl or boy. That is absolutely a crime and there should be a provision for punishment. The punishment should be much more than what we have provided in this Bill. Ombudsman job is very nice. Most of the time people cannot go to the court and file a case. Any institution engaging more than 25 people or a 50 bed hospital should have the ombudsman. I would like to add a provision here to the effect that compensation shall be paid to the positive person if he undergoes mental stress because of the denial of the treatment. With good nutrition we can prolong death and in some cases even prevent it. Not only HIV, AIDS is also preventable. With these words, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Like many of my other colleagues, I also congratulate the hon.Minister for bringing out a wonderful legislation. In fact, we believe that prevention is better than cure. The more vulnerable group is women and children who need a special focus. We do not have comprehensive coordinative efforts on part of the State Governments and the Central Government. This only can result in effective control of the disease. I think we have to give special attention to the female sex workers, particularly at few places like Mumbai and Kolkata. We need to have a special programme, both in terms of awareness and treatment, for them. Denial either for the treatment or for other things should also be made a criminal offence. Instead of putting the responsibility of ombudsman on to the State Governments, the Government of India should take its responsibility. At least in big establishments having more than 100 people, some incentive may be given to the companies which appoint exclusive nodal officers so that the awareness could be created and some redressal mechanism could be evolved in the company itself. Insurance is extremely essential and it has to be made compulsory and the premium has to be paid by the Government for the simple reason that most of the victims are poor and illiterate. India has the lowest allocation in the world for health as a percentage of GDP. We should give more priority to education and health. Penal action should be taken against the doctors who deny treatment and also against those people who are responsible for stocking the drugs but do not do so.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a very important subject. I do not find the Financial memorandum and the Statement of Objects and Reasons in the Bill. The hon.Supreme Court of India has directed the Central Government to give ART medicine to all HIV victims. The Government has said that the ART medicine for each patient would cost around Rs.28,500. If we cannot give that much of amount for the victim of HIV, how can we cure the patients in this country? We have seen 50 per cent reduction in the number of new HIV infection. The total estimated HIV affected persons in our country are 2.08 million as per a report of 2011. What steps have been taken in our country to manufacturer generic antiretroviral drug in our country? It is a good Bill. HIV is very much influencing our population. It is also influencing our GDP and economy. This Bill aims to end this epidemic by 2030. This Bill has been drafted to safeguard the rights of the people who are affected by HIV. In my State of Kerala, we have seen that the rehabilitation of an HIV affected person is very difficult. The education of the HIV-affected persons and their children is very much difficult in schools. The Bill also aims to enhance access to health care services by ensuring consent and confidentiality for HIV related testing treatment and other clinical results. I think not only the Government but the entire nation should be involved in awareness programmes. Then only we can create a situation for the betterment of HIV-AIDS affected persons. The State and Central Government should ensure prevention of spread of HIV and AIDS and anti-retroviral and access to welfare schemes, especially for women and children. The HIV patients are not getting proper medical treatment in our hospitals. This is something very alarming. I think, Government should come out with some financial support to the States to ensure protection of the HIV patients and their rehabilitation and treatment in their respective states.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is one of the very good Bills drafted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. So, I would like to congratulate the hon.Minister for having brought forward this Bill. There is a social stigma attached to this disease. That has been removed by the provisions of this Bill. There is a clause in the insurance policies, which excludes HIV. My request to the hon.Minister is, this clause should be removed because that person who has taken that health policy or the life policy should not be discriminated on the basis of HIV infection. Secondly, if a couple is HIV infected and their health status is good, they should be given an opportunity for adoption. There is a need to waive the consent clause for conducting HIV tests in cases when the patient is suffering from severe medical problem not responding to treatment. It should be made mandatory in every hospital to have a ventilator and a hemodialysis for the HIV patients. Today, what is important in the country is educating the youth, educating the school-going children about these diseases. Many a times we hold the hospital responsible if the data is leaked about any HIV infected person. My request is that instead of holding the hospital responsible, we should hold the person who has leaked the data and he should be punished. There are many cases where even doctors and staff have been infected with HIV in the course of saving the lives of the patients. So, I think in such cases compensation should be given to the doctor or the staff who has got infected with this. Health related pre-marriage couselling should be stressed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The foremost requirement for nation building is the building of our character and we not only have to build our characters but also have to ensure that we remain healthy. We have to create awareness everywhere right from the schools to all other places. There is a need to open Health Centres for addressing the problem of malnutrition. I would like to say that this Bill is very good beginning to ensure that we remain healthy. The Government has expressed its concern over this major problem and the House has shown its solidarity in sharing the concern.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bill has been drafted to safeguard the rights of the people affected by HIV, address HIV related discrimination and strengthening the existing programme by bringing in legal accountability. After this Bill becomes law, no HIV person can be treated unfairly to live his day-to-day life whether at work or educational institutes or public or private offices. But at the same time, pre-marital HIV counseling should be made mandatory so that we can, in future, save not one life, but two lives - life of the partner as well as of the child. This ART should be made available to each and every HIV infected person. The life threatening infections/conditions related to HIV should be covered, and treatment should be given free of cost including treatment of tuberculosis and hepatitis. We should also try to give social security and social rehabilitation to the HIV infected persons. This should also be considered in the Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As per the figures by WHO there are approximately 22 lakhs AIDS and HIV infected patients in the country. The problem gets amplified due to the associated social stigma and boycott of the patients of this disease. Now it has become a very onerous task to change the mindset of the people. Awareness campaigns are being launched and laws are also being made to tackle the problem. However, we still need to ponder over as to how we can make people overcome their fear psychosis in this regard. The proposed Bill by the Government is a positive development in this direction. The Government has provided for extending facility of treatment to the patients, however, the proposed premium amount on insurance has been kept more than normal which does not appear appropriate. Insurance of HIV/AIDS infected patients should also be done on normal premium. Welfare schemes should be run for HIV/AIDS infected persons and every effort should be made to check the spread of this disease. It is the target of the World Health Organisation to wipe out HIV/AIDS from the world by the year 2030. Therefore, the Government may ensure that HIV/AIDS is eradicated from our country by this years.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I support this Bill. Clause 6 is regarding the 'informed consent'. If the healthcare provide strongly suspects that HIV is present, can such a provision be added wherein the health provider can go ahead and take the test without informed consent? The Government should remove "as far as possible" in Clause 14 and make it for all patients? Clause 10 relates to duty to prevent transmission of HIV. Why can the Government not add some punishment provisions? The foreign NGOs were doing HIV prevention services. Now, it has declined a lot. Will this Government enhance budgetary spending for this? One major reason of death in HIV is presence of infection such as TB. India has a very high prevalence of TB. So, the Government should also strengthen TB services and the ICT services.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill has two aspects - one is human immunity deficiency virus and the second is acquired deficiency syndrome. HIV decreases the immunity of a person and makes one infection prone. After becoming infection prone, a person becomes infected with a number of diseases. When a person is having acquired deficiency virus syndrome and we treat him in a hospital, that patient is discriminated against. As a result thereof, he does not get several facilities. The Bill will certainly pave the way for providing treatment facilities to the patients and the hospital staff will not be able to deny treatment to such patients. Most of the HIV patients also suffer from tuberculosis. I would like to suggest that a provision should be made for making it mandatory to test the tuberculosis patients for HIV infection. This Bill will prove extremely beneficial in terms of providing treatment to the patients and also in terms of achieving our WHO mandated target in this regard.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is really a great blot on the head of our nation that we are at third position in the world as far as this stigma of AIDS is concerned. At present, approximately 3 crore 67 lakh people are suffering from this disease all over the world. Approximately 21 lakh people in our country are suffering from this disease. Very important suggestions have been made in the Standing Committee on Health. I would like to request the hon.Minister that though he has included most of the suggestions, there are certain suggestions given by my colleagues which need to be included. The Bill also provides for expanding the scope of preventive measures and preserving the confidentiality of the patients. There are 19800 ICTC centres, 527 ART centres and 1108 linked ART centres in the country to give Anti-retro viral therapy. The Government has introduced a toll- free number 1097 on which any person in the country can get the solution of his problems.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is gross lack of awareness in this regard. There is no provision in this Bill to spread awareness. If someone is HIV positive, either he or his family faces social boycott. There should be provision of counseling in this regard. Sometimes blood supplied from the blood banks is also infected. The blood is transfused to the patients without testing it. We should consider this aspect also.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A considerable section of our society is affected by HIV. The government has taken an important measure to rid the people of this disease and to prevent it. More awareness is needed in this regard. Rehabilitation is more important than treatment.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I congratulate the hon.Minister for having such a comprehensive Bill after detailed discussion in the Standing Committee, in Rajya Sabha and also in this House. Globally, there are 36.7 million people, who are living with HIV. India has third largest population of people living with HIV with an estimated 21 lakh people after South Africa and Nigeria. It is satisfying to note that the national HIV epidemic has declined over the last 15 years or so. We hope, this Bill will give further boost to India's efforts in fulfilling the global commitments towards ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030. People living with HIV are still dying in our country, particularly when co-infected with TB or Hepatitis-C even when we have knowledge and means to prevent such deaths. The Bill says that the Central Government and the State Governments may try their level best to give measures for providing Anti- Retroviral drugs as far as possible. Our suggestion is that 'as far as possible' may be deleted and a specific assurance may be given in this House. India supplies more than 80 per cent of the Anti-Retroviral medicines globally but it seems to be hesitating in committing to provide treatment to its own citizens. Even with all the years of awareness and education, we have instances of stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV. These are the challenges we must particularly have in mind while making rules in this regard. The discrimination is also well addressed in this Bill. I fully support this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I thank all the hon.Members who have participated in the discussion on this Bill. Whatever suggestion have come, seek better implementation of the Bill. India has gone a long way in the field of medicine with regard to AIDS. Parliamentary forums, civil society groups, activists and NGOs - all played a proactive role to give their suggestions to the government and the Standing Committee. In 1980s, it was projected that AIDS will become an endemic and epidemic and India will be the epicenter of this disease. We are providing for free treatment of any HIV positive person in this Bill. India has succeeded to great extent in its prevention. Millennium Development Goals - 4 had target that we would arrest and reverse tuberculosis, HIV and malaria. We have surpassed these goals that is we have arrested and reversed the incidence of these diseases. Free anti-retro viral treatment is being provided to 10 lakh people living with HIV positive and this is the single largest ART programme in the world. There are 22,000 testing facilities in India which are conducting 2.9 crore HIV tests annually. There was a time when AIDS drugs were very costly. But Indian pharmacies have manufactured affordable drugs with which we are treating not only Indian people but also the entire Africa. We have associated community people in high-risk areas to conduct aggressive awareness programme. One point raised was that there is no provision of funding in this Bill. It is expressly provided in this Bill that the central and the State Governments will provide free ART. This is 100 per cent Centrally- sponsored scheme. Earlier, treatment of a patient started when his CD-4 count reached 350 levels. But last year we have decided that treatment will start even when the CD-4 count reaches 500 levels. Now the government is planning to start the treatment just after testing positive. Standing Committee gave 11 suggestions out of which the government has accepted 10. The same committee had suggested to keep the words 'as far as possible'. But at the same time I would like to assure the House that even a single patient will not be left out. The government will provide the treatment. A number of issues have been raised. One is about ombudsman. It is not necessary that there will be only one ombudsman, there may be two. The State Government has to decide on this count. It is mandatory for the blood banks to test the blood for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV before storing it. Till now we were following the guidelines but now after this enactment discrimination with any HIV positive person will be an offence. We are leaders in manufacturing of anti-retro viral drug. We are not only connected with the patient, we are also connected with the patient's family. So when the patient goes somewhere, we know how to track him. We will see to it that every minor thing is addressed while making rules. This is a historical day. The House will pass this Bill which will help in eliminating HIV. The Bill was passed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
