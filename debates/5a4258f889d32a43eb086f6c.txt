When the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill was enacted, two separate administrative units were carved out. The development of both the states was talked about and it was mulled over as to how Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will make progress. One of the better offshoots and well thought out decisions from the discussion was the establishment of a world class Petroleum and Energy Institute in Andhra Pradesh. In the Schedule 13 of the said Act, it was decided that Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy would be opened in Visakhapatnam for the purpose of increasing the skilled manpower. It has been given the shape of an institute by setting up a society. The initial financial arrangement has also been made and it is already into the completion of first year of its academic session. So far admission of 50 students each in two separate courses of petroleum and chemical engineering has been given for the academic session 2016-17. IIT Khadagpur will work as the mentor institute of this proposed institute. I have brought this Bill before the House to give the status of institution of national importance to the said institute. The Government has also made an expenditure outlay of approximately Rs.650 crore for this purpose.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The objective of this Bill is to meet the quantitative and qualitative gap in the supply of skilled manpower for the petroleum sector and to promote research activity needed for the growth of the sector. On behalf of my party I congratulate the Government of Andhra Pradesh for giving 200 acres of land free of cost to this institute. A temporary campus of IIPE has been set up for academic session of 2016-17. The Cabinet has approved a sum of Rs.655 crore as capital expenditure to set up IIPE and a contribution of Rs.200 crore towards its Endowment Fund in addition to a contribution of Rs.2,000 crore from oil companies towards the Endowment Fund. This sector contributes 16-17 per cent to the GDP of our country. There is a huge demand for skilled manpower for the growth of this sector. Before the assumption of power by this Government, the rate of crude oil in the global market was between $112-115 per barrel. After this Government assumed power, the crude oil has been hovering around $50 per barrel but the benefit of low price has not been passed to the people. Now the Government has decided to scrap the subsidies altogether which is a anti-poor decision. The middle class is expanding fast in the country and their consumption power is also increasing. When middle class and the consumption expands it will result in economic growth requiring a huge amount of energy. We had formulated the Integrated Energy Policy keeping this trend in our mind. We want the Government to focus more on oil and natural gas sector. The per capita energy consumption in our country is low. Energy consumption is likely to grow due to macroeconomic tailwinds. The Government should adopt better policy in order for the country to move ahead fulfilling its requirements. India has not witnessed any major oil discovery during the last one and a half decade therefore our dependence on imports has been increased. We need to come over this dependency syndrome. The experts are of the opinion that India has a huge potential in terms of shale gas. If we are able to exploit it optimally then we can rest assured for the next 200 years.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the State of Andhra Pradesh was divided into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there was not even a single institution of national importance in the divided Andhra Pradesh because all the institution were left in Telangana. As far as the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act is concerned, it assures the establishment of Petroleum University in the State of Andhra Pradesh and this assurance is being fulfilled by our young and dynamic Minister of Petroleum and Nature Gas. This Bill is being introduced to declare it as an Institution of national importance. I hope the hon.Minister will give autonomy to this Institute to design its own curriculum. I would request the hon.Minister to allocate the funds that are required as per the construction of the buildings of the Institute so that the Institute comes up with necessary infrastructure at the earliest. This institute is being established to create skilled manpower in the field of petrochemical engineering and also to provide research activities for this sector. I thank the Government of Andhra Pradesh for coming forward to allot around 200 acres of land free of cost to set up this institute there. This institute being established in Andhra Pradesh because Andhra Pradesh is having about 974 kms. Long sea coast and KG Basin promises a huge potential for exploitation of crude oil and natural gas. I mentioned about the presence of hydrate in the Bay of Bengal. The hon.Minister is aware about the discovery of hydrates in the KG Basin area. I wish that this institute will undertake research activity in the exploration of these hydrates. When these hydrates are exploited, India will become self-sufficient in energy field.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Institute is very essential. It is being set up in Vizag, which already has a petroleum refinery. It is close to the Krishna- Godavari Basin where oil has been found. It is ideally situated. This institute is being set up as a follow up of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 where it was promised that Andhra Pradesh will have a new petroleum institute. Now, as far as this Institute is concerned, it is being structured in the likes of the IITs. The only thing is that the hon.Minister has to bring another Bill so that it can be declared as an Institute of national importance. I want the Minister to make this new Institute free from the apron string of the Government. Let all these things be decided by the Governing Council of the Institute itself. It is of great importance to find more petroleum sources. Oil exploration had started in the Sundarban's area of West Bengal but that was given up. I would urge the hon.Minister to ensure that the exploration for petroleum can take place in the Bay of Bengal Basin of West Bengal. I would like to request the Government to also initiate the Post- Graduate courses immediately, also to start doctoral research.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are happy that through this step Andhra Pradesh, which is not really a new State, will see further development. These days, these times are times when we should be talking about energy synergy. There is a need to harness the potential of both conventional as well as renewable sources of energy. Our dependence on fossil fuels needs to be challenged. People should be encouraged to increase their dependence on renewable energy. I have a suggestion. Just call this Institute, the Indian Institute of Energy. While the proposed university can work towards developing better technology, involving renewable energy, it should simultaneously work towards reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons. I would suggest that all the related institutes should be brought together under one umbrella. They may be mandated to work on methods how to get rid of those which pollute the atmosphere and whose use damages the earth. Therefore, move away from those sources of energy into alternative energy. In these institutes research would be focused on finding new renewable sources of energy and encouraging their adoption throughout the country. Even the General Council has members only from hydrocarbon industry who will obviously not like the country to move to renewable energy. The membership composition implies that traditional thought and traditional mindset will not only continue, it shall be further strengthened with private enterprise.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The proposed institute aims to provide high quality education and research focusing on the themes of petroleum, hydrocarbons and energy. We would like the government to start an institute of same kind in Tamil Nadu. The extraction of hydrocarbon from Tamil Nadu has become a burning issue. The Union Government has approved a proposal to extract hydrocarbon from Neduvasal and other places in Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu. This has raised apprehension among the villagers that this may be a move to extract hydrocarbons which is against the interests of the farmers. But the government is unwilling to scrap the Neduvasal hydrocarbon extraction project. The Union Government, instead of solving this burning issue, is adding fuel by their move to sign the MoU. I urge the Union Government to stop the extraction of hydrocarbons in any form from Neduvasal and neighbouring villages in Pudukkottai. I also strongly urge the Union Government to close all the wells already dug for pilot projects and cancel the land lease agreements between the ONGC and the farmers and handover the lands to the farmers ensuring that the interests of the farmers are fully safeguarded.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As far as energy is concerned, all over the world with regard to hydrocarbons and shell gas, there are issues coming out presently in the energy sector. We have found that we fail in many of the wells that are dug for shell gas. This institute will give us some directive and guidance in that regard as it is a research institute. I feel that there will be more stress on research work in the institute. When the shell gas production started throughout the world, the risk came down and the petroleum industry are shattered a bit. The petrol companies faced losses because they had purchased the crude oil at a higher price. The next most important thing of the institute is its curriculum. When we form an institute of national importance. The curriculum should be of a global standard. We should have a faculty staff who is well versed with the latest technological changes to impart education of a very high quality to our students. I feel that Mumbai, particularly the coastal belt of Mumbai is also an appropriate place for such an institute. Therefore, I request the Government to think of setting up of an institute of national importance in Mumbai also. SHRI MUTHAMSETTI SRINIVASA RAO (AVANTHI): I convey my sincere thanks to our Chief Minister for granting 200 acres of land, the cost of which comes to more than Rs.400 crore. In accordance with 13th Schedule of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, the Indian Institute of petroleum and Energy has been set up. The institute will provide high quality education and conduct advance research in all aspects relating to the conventional hydrocarbons. In this connection, I want to make some suggestions for the kind consideration of the hon.Minister, while appointing the non-gazetted staff, he should give instructions to the institute to recruit local people instead of recruiting people from outside the State. I suggest to the hon.Minister to release funds smoothly so that the construction of the institute takes place at a fast pace. I would also like to request the hon.Minister to start an incubation centre on par with the institution so that the creative or innovative minds of the youth of this country may be utilized for the development of this country. Moreover, we have to give training to the present students to meet future challenges arising out of automation and business activities getting more and more based on internet so that after some time they do not get insured in respect of their jobs. I would like to thank the Government of India once again for sanctioning seven educational institutions in three years. It is a great achievement of our State after Independence as no other State got seven institutions in these three years. Along with education, we should also include introducing students to yoga, ethical values, culture, tradition, etc. This is the legacy that we can give to the future generations.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are happy that the Government is setting up the Indian Institute of Petroleum with an investment of Rs.655 crore as capital and Rs.250 crore as endowment, and declaring this institution as an institute of national importance. We are requesting him that there are many pending issues in the Telangana State also. It is already mentioned in the Reorganization Bill that the Indian Institute of management (IIM) would be there and we have allocated land for it, but three years have passed and there is no initiation from the Government side or the particular Department. Another issue is the Horticulture University promised under the State Reorganization Act 2014, which is still pending as well as the Tribal University. Hence, I would like to request the Ministry to take initiation for the establishment of a Tribal University in Telangana.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have a lot of institutions under the Petroleum Ministry but the functioning of such institutions is not good. Recently, the Ministry has appointed a permanent Director in one of the institutions. It is a welcome step. Only when we strive to strengthen our own industry, we can meet the challenges. The first institute established in this area in 1960 is Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, Uttarakhand with technical support of the CSIR, Uttarakhand. The second institute came into being in 2008 in Rai Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh by an Act of Parliament. As far as the Board of Governors is concerned, we do not have representation from the ONGC, OIDB and others institutions. The Government is looking for the merger of all the oil companies to form a bigger oil company. I would request the Government to admit this Institute under the JV. But, recently, we have had many complaints about this joint venture. It included incidence of bribe, capitation fee and so on. This led to the subversion of the admission process. I would request the Minister to look into this matter personally especially about the Rajiv Gandhi Institute. Besides, I would also request the Minister to start one such Institute in Cochin, as there are many major institutions like HPCL, BPCL and the PETRONET is also there in Cochin.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy is one of the prestigious Institutes granted to Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation of the State in 2014. The objective of this university should be to meet the quantitative and qualitative gap in the supply of skilled manpower for the petroleum sector and to promote research activities needed for the growth of the sector. To make the institute a world-class university, adequate infrastructure has to be provided. The institute cannot function and provide qualitative research and internship programmes with only four faculty members. The Government needs to consider this aspect. I congratulate the Government for setting up IIPE in Andhra Pradesh and support the Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Institute of Petroleum and Energy is a part of our Government's promise and commitment to the Andhra Pradesh when it was bifurcated. This Institute will fill the gap of qualitative and quantitative need for oil sector by promoting research and development work in both petroleum and petroleum related energy sector. I would urge the hon.Minister to restart the Shivasagar Petroleum Institute in Assam. I hope he will establish such type of institutes all over the country, especially in the North- Eastern region because there is dearth of talented and skilled people.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017 is related with the sanction for the setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy at Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh. I would like to put forth a few questions related with my State. The Union Government may set up Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy in North Eastern States including Bihar which could be a special package to remove the backwardness of Bihar. I demand special status for Bihar. I want that Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy be set up in my Parliamentary Constituency of Banka. I would like to thank the hon.Minister for sanctioning the setting up of a gas bottling plant in my Parliamentary Constituency of Banka Barahat in regard to which work has already commenced. I would like early completion of this gas bottling plant.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I support the Bill, because there is a need to seriously discuss the issues concerning petroleum and renewable energy. I would like to say that the petroleum companies would benefit from the research and development work of the proposed institute. So, we should make these petroleum companies partner and take contribution from them. We have to have some kind of bond so that the students graduating from this Institute should undertake research work for at least five years. I would like to make one more request, because this institute is likely to largely focus on KG basin. There are other areas like refineries in Panipat and Bhatinda. We should set up institutes in these areas also.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I support the Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017. If we carefully go through the contents of the Bill, it clearly mentions that since energy sector is developing with traditional hydrocarbon sector and new sources of energy like liquified natural gas, bio-energy and renewable energy are also coming in the market with hydrocarbons, this institute would undertake advance research work in these areas to secure and maintain leading position in this field. As we are aware that the traditional hydrocarbon sources are decreasing and it is required for the future of the coming generations to focus on non-traditional sources and new sources of energy. There is big reserves of oil shales in India which could certainly be used for future generations. I would request the hon.Minister that western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan are such States where there are sufficient reserves of hydrocarbons and non-traditional hydrocarbons, so one such institute should also be set up there. At last, I want to say that our government believes in knowing and then doing the right thing.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill is very important, because petroleum products are of utmost importance in this country. I think that the proposed institute to be set up through this Bill would enable our students to take education there and it would benefit the country in the future. You have brought Petroleum and Energy Institute of national importance in the State of Andhra Pradesh. If such an institute is also set up in Punjab, it would be very useful. These days petroleum products are heavily taxed. There is a need to reduce the taxes on petroleum products, particularly for the benefit of agriculture sector. DR. RATNA DE (NAG): The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017 aims to set up an Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy at Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I appreciate the aim of the Bill as it provides high quality education and research focusing on the themes of petroleum, hydrocarbons and energy. Would the hon.Minister state what is the plan of action in place as of now particularly when our aim is very challenging and the amount to be spent is so huge? The said Institute is aimed at extending high quality education and conduct advance research in all aspects relating to the conventional hydrocarbons. I appreciate the exalted aim. I would like to know from the hon.Minister what measures were put in place to make the functioning of the institute transparent and accountable. There is an urgent need to bring foreign faculty, who are experts and who know what new developments and innovations are taking place in the realm of petroleum and energy sector. I am representing West Bengal. Would the hon.Minister consider setting up an institution of national importance to cater to the emerging and challenging needs in the domain of petroleum and energy in West Bengal?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I support this Bill. I hope this institution would be invested in making the country self-reliant in the field of energy. The oil prices are at its lowest level of the last 10-15 years. But the common man is not benefitting from it. I would like to request the hon.Minister that the benefit of reduced prices should reach the poor also. The prices of domestic LPG should not be beyond the reach of the common man. I come from Bihar. An ambitious project namely 'Haldia-Jagdishpur Pipeline Project' is being executed there by the government. I would request the hon.Minister that the network of this pipeline project should be extended across the State of Bihar, so that the common man could get clean fuel at lower prices.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Union Cabinet under the chairmanship of hon.Prime Minister has sanctioned the setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy in Vishakhapatanam of Andhra Pradesh. This will be an institution of national importance as per the Act passed by the Parliament. Through this Bill, the Government is going to fulfil another promise of public interest. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has provided to the Union Government 200 acres of land at Atakapalli village in Vishakhapatanam sometime back free of cost. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people and Government of Andhra Pradesh. One important thing in this regard is that the Government of India has given this institution the status of national importance so that high quality facilities are made available over here.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Indian Institute of Petroleum being set up in Vishakhapatanam through this Bill, is a very good initiative. Besides petroleum, alternative energy sources are being explored across the world. I want that such an institute be set up in Bhatinda as well. If an Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy is setup in North-India also, the talented engineers of our country would be able to serve in the country itself.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ujjwala Scheme has covered the villages extensively. Research is going on all over the world on solar and wind energy. Our Government also is engaged in giving a new dimension to this field. Certainly, we need to strengthen our research activities. To make this an institute of global standards we should enter into agreements with leading nations of the world. Gas is flared round the clock in Barauni and Agra refineries. It should be tapped and bottled through research.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to support the Bill. I congratulate the NDA Government led by the Prime Minister for honouring the commitment made by the UPA Government in this regard. In the petroleum sector, we do not have an institute of national importance. We have to convert this into an institute of global importance. I feel that this Institute will provide and deliver professional experts in the field of oil and gas sector. State of Rajasthan has abundant resources of oil. But unfortunately we are not able to explore oil in Rajasthan and Assam. Prime importance should be given to oil exploration for which self-sufficiency in oil exploration technology is also highly required. I hope this Institute will help a lot towards that end. IOCL, HPCL, BPCL, ONGC and all other organizations in the petroleum and natural gas sector should be protected. In my constituency, Hindustan Petroleum Company stopped its entire operations 20 years back and 27 acres of land is lying. I urge upon the hon.Minister to start some institute in that place and utilize that land. SHRI RAVINDER KUSHAWAHA: I support the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017. This institute will play a major role in the development and this will be a big step. Our youths will get quality education and serve the petroleum sector. It is my desire that a Transport University should also be set up on these lines so that accidents can come down. Similarly, Rail University should also be set up.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The condition of research in India is very pitiable. Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill will prove to be a milestone. It is my request that such an institute be set up in northern India also. Much research is needed in the field of solar energy, wind energy and alternative energy. Barauni refinery the only major refinery was set up 70 years ago. My suggestion is that through the CSR initiative the institute can be developed. There are immense reserves in Purnia, Baisee and between Bengal and Assam which needs to be explored. There is no shortage of reserves in India. What lacks is research. I congratulate you for setting up such an institute.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

23 Hon.Members gave valuable suggestions on this Bill. Had shale gas not been discovered in America then perhaps the politics and economy of the world would have been different. We might have seen oil prices at 100 dollars. At the time of reorganization the previous government rightly decided to have an institute of national importance for Andhra Pradesh keeping in view the needs of the nation. This will benefit not only Andhra Pradesh but also the economy of the country and the world as it will help our youths get employment. The institute will not only cater to research and education in petroleum engineering and petroleum energy but attention will also be on alternative non-fossil hydro-carbon and alternative energy. There is widespread discussion regarding next generation energy. Hydrate is one such topic. Japan, America, China and India are the leading economies researching on gas hydrates. Krishna-Godavari basin has the potential to become a prolific basin, which in the coming days, perhaps for hundreds of years may meet the energy needs of the country. Where is the challenge? The challenge is regarding how to monetize it. How to extract it? The KG Basin will have the same place as Houston has in the global oil economy, research and trade. Can our scientists not turn Vizag, Vishakhapatanam, Kakinada or Rajamundri in future into Houston. I am fully convinced that these in future can become Houston. Perhaps, this will become possible through the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy. The Prime Minister told the world that India is most conscious regarding environment. India is the least polluting country. Employment to locals would certainly are focus. There is no question of hiring outsiders as non-teaching staff. The youths of Andhra Pradesh will get employment. Study will also be on the safety aspect. The Prime Minister is committed to provide on a long-term basis to the poor the supply of cheap and continuous energy, clean energy as well as safe energy. The Bill was passed.
