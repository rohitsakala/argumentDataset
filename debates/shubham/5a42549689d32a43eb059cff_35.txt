 We disapprove of this Bill as our problem is with the way in which this Government has implemented it. Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed the GST when the Opposition was not present in the Assembly. The Opposition claimed that this was a violation of Jammu & Kashmir Constitution and of Article 370 because it eroded the State's special status in terms of its own financial autonomy and its legislative powers which are reserved for the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. By impinging upon the power of the State to impose taxes, the Government is violating the fundamental power of that Government. By extending GST to Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre gains effective control of the taxation in the State. That was, of course, something which was reserved by the Constitution for the State Government. The State has been dealing with conflict for a long time and we must absolutely not do anything that might harm its stability. GST tax rates are far more complicated than it needs to be. This is the Minister who told us that he was opposed to tax terrorism, instead what we are seeing is tax form terrorism. We are seeing something which obviously is going to cause a whole amount of problems, increasing works for everybody involved in business. There is a particular problem when it relates to Jammu and Kashmir. Its principle revenue generation is tourism which has been affected by terrorism. The 28 per cent GST now is going to affect all of the tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. If this is not rolled back, it is likely to make Kashmir uncompetitive in tourism. My State, Kerala has become uncompetitive in tourism because the tax rate is driving up the cost beyond any of our neighbouring States. GST has been applied at the rate of 12 per cent on highway construction which is going to come to a halt. I do want to stress finally that there is also a great threat of litigation coming up about which tax brackets, which companies fall into and how their goods should be categorised. The Government has raised the cost of many goods for GST. The current Government version of GST, I am sorry, would have a negative effect on GDP instead of a positive one and it would actually fulfil the warning of the National Institute of Public Policy. The Parliament today must contemplate the impact of GST on the Centre's relation with J&K before we make the major mistake of passing this Bill without adequate consultation with the stakeholders.

It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard.
