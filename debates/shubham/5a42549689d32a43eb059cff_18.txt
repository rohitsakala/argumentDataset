 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Jammu and Kashmir is the only State that missed the 1st July roll-out date of GST and joined the new indirect tax fold making GST one-tax, one-nation regime. By providing safeguards to the special status to the State, the country has sent out a message to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that India cares for its sensitivity. The constitutional safeguards for the State as per Section 5 of the constitution of the State which empowers the State to levy tax-shall remain intact. After the roll out of the GST, textile sector in the country has been badly hit and needs to be exempted from the GST net. Otherwise, the textile sector will be uncompetitive. Items relating to disabled/handicapped persons should also be exempted from the GST. Unfortunately, the items of luxury are being prioritized instead of aids and appliances that are extremely essential for disabled persons in their routine life. There has to be a proper coordination between the Centre and States for effective implementation of GST. With these words, I support the Bill.
