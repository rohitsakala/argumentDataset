 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill.

 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this.
