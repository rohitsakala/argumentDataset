 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++It is a very straightforward and simple bill. Hon.Prime Minister had a dream of 'one nation, one tax'. There were many efforts in this direction. Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of all States were called. All were made aware of the importance of GST. When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir, we can understand why it was not implemented there at the same time. It was not possible because of Article 370 of the Constitution. BJP is a partner in Jammu and Kashmir Government. Why is there delay even then? We spend lakhs and crores of rupees from the consolidated fund of India in protecting Jammu and Kashmir. We provide special package. We faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. In reality, we were victorious but a part of Kashmir is still occupied by Pakistan. Pak-occupied Kashmir means our land occupied by Pakistan and terrorist camps have come up there. Terrorism is affecting us for years. We are proud of the surgical strike by our forces. We were shown the video in the Home Ministry in which our Jawans crossed the border and destroyed more than 40 terrorist camps within 12 hours. On the other hand, there is China. This is a majority government hence, Article 370 of the Constitution should be abolished. It is important to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir as well, so we are supporting this Bill.
