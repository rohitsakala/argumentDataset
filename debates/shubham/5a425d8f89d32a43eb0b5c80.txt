 More than seventy per cent of the Indian population lives in the rural areas. A revolutionary decision of nationalising the banks took place on 19th July, 1969 because agriculture was not at all considered as one of the areas where the banks are supposed to give credit to the farmers. That was the rationale behind taking a drastic decision to nationalise the banks. The State Bank of India is now feeling as a big brother. The State Bank of Mysore, which was in existence in Karnataka, had a lot of branches in the rural areas. A lot of agricultural and subsidiary crop loans were given to the farmers by the State Bank of Mysore. But by merging that bank with the State Bank of India, the people of this country, particularly the rural people, are feeling that there is some infringement of their rights in terms of getting loans from the nationalised banks. Only the corporate sector and the bigwigs are capable of entering this bank. The common man will now feel that the State Bank of India is not his bank. There are Rs.1.8 lakh crore of NPAs in the State Bank of India. Everyone feels that NPAs are only in SBI, but it is there in all commercial banks and it is a big sum of money which has gone waste and it is at the cost of the poor people that this amount is growing. The State Bank of India is imposing some stringent conditions on customers. Nearly 31 crore people of this country are going to be affected by this stringent action by the State Bank of India with regard to keeping a minimum balance in the saving accounts. This is a very bad decision. Furthermore, the bank proposes to impose charges for cash withdrawal and also service charges. All these decisions are anti-poor. I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that people in this country, particularly the farmers are in a very critical condition. On the one hand, there is excessive rain in Northern India and on the other there is no rain in Southern India. The State of Karnataka is reeling under drought for the last five to six years. The suicide by farmers has assumed alarming proportions in this country. The Government of Karnataka took a revolutionary decision of waiving the loan of the farmers to the tune of Rs.8261 crore. I would therefore urge upon the Government of India to waive the farmers loans in the commercial banks so as to enable the farmers to breathe peacefully at least for sometimes to prevent farmers suicides in the country.

 This Bill seeks to repeal the two Acts relating to banks. These banks were subsidiaries of the State Bank of India. The Union Cabinet granted its approval in February, 2017 which allowed the SBI to acquire the subsidiaries, and the SBI Act, 1955 is further amended right now. The guiding principle for the consolidation process of banking in India has so far been as per the Narasimhan Committee recommendations. Any initiative with respect to merger of public sector banks has to come from the Board of the bank concerned. For the purposes of rationalization of resources, reduction of costs, better profitability, lower cost of funds leading to better rate of interest for public at large, improve productivity and customer service, SBI, with the sanction of the Central Government, is now having a consolidation for which these consequential amendments are required. Following the merger, total customer base of the SBI has increased to the tune of 40 crores with a branch network of 24,000 and nearly 59,000 ATMs across the country. SBI has become the largest commercial bank in India in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees. Having made this significant investment in technology, SBI is in a position to offer the widest portfolio of digital products and services. Thanks to the merger, additional customers will access and benefit through these products. The Narasimham Committee had envisaged in 1991 that the SBI should progressively merge all the seven subsidiaries with itself. Long thereafter, in 2008, the State Bank of Saurashtra was the first to merge with the SBI. Two years later, the State Bank of Indore was integrated. First, the associated banks had enjoyed a common identity with the SBI for long. Second, the SBI had been exercising the tight operational control of the associated banks from inception. Third, all associated banks were operating under the same Information Technology platform like the SBI. In 2002, it had engaged Tata Consultancy Services to roll out a core banking solution covering the entire group. So, the associated banks were beneficiaries of the common code and the linkages. Fourth, the treasury operations of the associated banks had been integrated with the SBI for several years. Lastly, the major loan decisions of the Associated Banks used to be vetted first by the SBI under centralized control before the proposals received local approval at the concerned associated Banks' Board. In Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Accounts, there is no restriction or there is no penalty for not maintaining a minimum balance. Consolidation in the banking sector is the need of the hour. Capital Adequacy Ratio for many Public Sector Banks, especially the smaller ones have been steadily declining mainly due to higher provisioning requirements for poor asset quality. It is also not possible for the Government to always step in with capital infusion into the banks due to budgetary constraints. Against this backdrop, consolidation in the banking sector assumes significance and a certain criticality with a view to salvaging the smaller and weaker PSB. On the human resource side, it will provide a larger pool of talent to tap into far ensuring better corporate governance. I would like to request our Government to open more bank branches in the rural areas. My suggestion would be that in the name of financial inclusion, which we have started now, we have to give loan to the marginal and the small famers. If the government can do something on this front, it will be appreciated.
