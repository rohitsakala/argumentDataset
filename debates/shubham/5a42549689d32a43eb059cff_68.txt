We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?

By providing safeguards to the special status to the State, the country has sent out a message to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that India cares for its sensitivity. The constitutional safeguards for the State as per Section 5 of the constitution of the State which empowers the State to levy tax-shall remain intact. After the roll out of the GST, textile sector in the country has been badly hit and needs to be exempted from the GST net. Otherwise, the textile sector will be uncompetitive. Items relating to disabled/handicapped persons should also be exempted from the GST. Unfortunately, the items of luxury are being prioritized instead of aids and appliances that are extremely essential for disabled persons in their routine life. There has to be a proper coordination between the Centre and States for effective implementation of GST. With these words, I support the Bill.
