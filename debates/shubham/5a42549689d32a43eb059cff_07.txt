 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++It is a very straightforward and simple bill. Hon.Prime Minister had a dream of 'one nation, one tax'. There were many efforts in this direction. Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of all States were called. All were made aware of the importance of GST. When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir, we can understand why it was not implemented there at the same time. It was not possible because of Article 370 of the Constitution. BJP is a partner in Jammu and Kashmir Government. Why is there delay even then? We spend lakhs and crores of rupees from the consolidated fund of India in protecting Jammu and Kashmir. We provide special package. We faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. In reality, we were victorious but a part of Kashmir is still occupied by Pakistan. Pak-occupied Kashmir means our land occupied by Pakistan and terrorist camps have come up there. Terrorism is affecting us for years. We are proud of the surgical strike by our forces. We were shown the video in the Home Ministry in which our Jawans crossed the border and destroyed more than 40 terrorist camps within 12 hours. On the other hand, there is China. This is a majority government hence, Article 370 of the Constitution should be abolished. It is important to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir as well, so we are supporting this Bill.
