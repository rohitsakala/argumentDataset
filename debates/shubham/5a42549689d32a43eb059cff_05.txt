 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard.
