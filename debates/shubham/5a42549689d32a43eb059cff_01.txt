 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised.
