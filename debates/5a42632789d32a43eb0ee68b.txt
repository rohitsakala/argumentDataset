India has been recognized world over as the IT soft power. To promote this IT industry, we provided IIITs in Government sector. Later on it was felt that there should be public-private partnership and 20 such IIITs with public-private partnership were mooted in 2010. Now, nearly 15 IIITs are already operational in the country. This year, their students will be graduating for the first time and IIIT Bill provides for granting degrees to their students. But IIIT public-private partnership mode is a different mode because there are different stakeholders. In IIITs, it is only the Central Government but in IIITPPP, it is the Central Government, the State Government and the private sector. So instead of amending the law, we have brought this Bill and I believe that this Bill will be passed unanimously. We will consider all the good suggestions made in this regard.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am glad to speak on this Bill as I started my professional career as software engineer. I would like to know from the hon.Minister of Human Resource Development about the two IIIT projects, one of which was already set up in Amethi and the other was to be set up in Sonepat. What are the reasons for closing down IIIT, Amethi and it being shifted to Allahabad alongwith its students. The proposed IIIT Sonepat lies in my parliamentary constituency whose foundation was laid by Pallam Raju ji and Choudhary Bhupinder Singh Hooda ji in 2003. Even the work thereon was started. But the work was stopped just after the change in the Government. I am talking about the two Lok Sabha parliamentary constituency where the Members of Parliament are from the opposition. I would like to request the Minister of Human Resource Development to tell about the reasons for the works not being started for these two IIITs and their campuses were not set up whereas the work on the remaining IIITs is going on. IT sector is a very crucial sector. But over a period of time the capacity of this sector to provide employment has waned. The economic slowdown as well as the increasing protectionist policy of the countries like USA are responsible for this situation. The restrictions imposed by the USA on its H-1B visa policy are specially responsible for this. The Prime Minister, himself, should come forward to clarify if he has taken up the matter with the USA during his recent visit to relax the restrictions placed on H-1B visa policy. If this is not done, the IT professionals of India will have to face many difficulties to work in the USA. I would also like to suggest that this Bill does not provide for the establishment of the extension centres of IIITs. Hence such provisions should be incorporated in this Bill enabling the establishment of extension centres of the flagship IIITs, like IIIT, Bengaluru and IIIT, Hyderabad so that the students of this area may also get admission therein. The most significant feature of the IT sector is that it does not require big infrastructure for its establishment. India dominates 56 per cent of IT trade in the world due to our silicon valley as compared to the USA. The Prime Minister should say that if the silicon valley of California is showing the path to the world, then the Bengaluru has gone a little ahead of it. At this point in time things appear to have been left on their own in the IT sector due to which the situation is going from bad to worse. So, this needs to be changed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to speak in favour of the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Bill, 2017. I would like to congratulate the hon.Minister of Human Resource Development for bringing such a visionary and historical Bill. This Bill will certainly usher in a new era of education, research and expansion in the sector of Information Technology in the country. This Bill is also significant for us as it will facilitate the emergence of such a far-reaching, effective and strong mechanism of the information technology education in the country which will cater to not only our needs but will also prove our strategic excellence in the field of information technology all over the world. The issues like the definition of public private partnership, the manner of its establishment, the ways of coordination among the center, states and industries, the manner of mooting the proposal by the Union Government and the manner of preparing MoU for it and the role of industry partners etc. have been lucidly explained in different clauses of this Bill. The work has also been done for the mobilization of funds for these institutes. The information technology has certainly played pivotal role in achieving remarkable economic progress as the information technology contributes about 10 percent of our GDP. According to NASSCOM this sector is going to create 30 lakh new employment opportunities by the year 2025. This Bill will to be a revolutionary step for the world and will usher in a new era. This Bill seeks to provide legitimacy to their degrees conferred upon their students as well as to provide legal status to these 15 institutes of PPP mode. These institutes will automatically get their autonomy having been declared as institutes of national importance. This will also facilitate the creation of conducive atmosphere for research on their education. This Bill also seeks to establish better coordination through autonomy and accountability and to set up the excellent academic institutes of information technology. How to prepare our students, our faculties and our scientists on global standards is also the fundamental objective of this Bill. 2.5 lakh villages have been envisaged to be brought under the ambit of Digital India and this also stands reinforced through this Bill. This Bill specially provides for formulation of a strategy to be adopted by these 15 institutes to mobilize their funds and execute the same to become an autonomous body. This will turn out to be crucial in the employment creation also. I would like to conclude with this request that an IIIT should be set up in Uttarakhand also.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill provides for establishment of institutes through collaboration among the Centre, the State Government and the industry partners. The capital investment has to be borne in the ratio of 50:35:15 among the Centre, the State Government and the industry partner. As the State Government has to give land measuring between 50 acres and 100 acres free of cost, the expected capital investment for States may be reduced to 20 per cent and the Centre may increase its own share to 65 per cent, keeping the share of the industry unchanged. We welcome the initiative of the Government of opting for the PPP mode for developing such institutions. This mode of PPP should be extended to the self-financed institutions in the engineering and medical fields also. The Government may think over it and bring in a comprehensive Bill for this purpose in future. I would like to take this opportunity to point two issues. Firstly, confusion was created as grace marks were given this year to the 12th class students of CBSE. Though everybody agrees that there should be normalisation in marks, one similar set procedure is not followed throughout the country. Secondly, every Board has different set of procedures for doing this. Unless we have common syllabus and common Board there cannot be clarity on this issue, and there cannot be any equalization in studies and marks. So, I would urge the Government to firstly ponder over this aspect.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bill proposes to set up Indian Institute of Information Technology in public-private partnership mode. In this model, there will be autonomy in governance that will help in addressing the present challenges faced by the Indian information technology industry in our country. It will help in growth of the domestic information technology market including developing new knowledge areas and creating skilled manpower of global standards. It is extremely necessary that we create world-class education centres to develop skilled manpower in emerging sectors. Fifteen functional Indian Institutes of Information Technology in public private partnership mode are proposed to be declared as Institutes of national importance. The Government hopes that trained personnel from these Institutes shall fulfill the growing demand for skilled, technical manpower in emerging IT sectors and the economy as a whole. Establishing IIITs in Public Private Partnership and subsequently declaring them as Institute of national importance would help in providing world-class education to students to foster research and development and make the way for India becoming a world-class leader. I would request the hon.Minister of Human Resource Development to please note that the Kalyani IIIT, West Bengal has no permanent building. Also, parity in fee- structure among the different IIITs would help in promoting standardization and equality. I would like to request the Government to clarify that if Government funding is only for five years what will happen thereafter. These institutions may increase the fee making it difficult for the poor students.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I support this Bill. Although this Bill is about IIITs, it concerns higher education. Everyone demands IITs, IIMs, IIITs and institutes of higher education but nobody talks about the quality of education. We have 'entrance' tests, but not 'exit' tests. The amount of money being wasted because of inferior teaching and training levels is mind-boggling. Corporations would save much if the pass-outs are effective and readily employable. That will definitely benefit the Indian economy immediately. This Bill appears to be a step in the right direction. By allowing industry participation in management of IITs, we will ensure that the right kind of exposure is provided to students before they pass out. The Bill proposes a ratio of 50:35:15 for the Central, State and private investors respectively. It would be better if this set of ratio is not mentioned in the law but issued through regulations after the law is passed. It would be beneficial because then the Government can moderate the share of each parties according to the conditions prevalent in future. Teacher recruitment is becoming a serious problem in higher education institutes. The pay for the teaching jobs needs to be increased and made more and more attractive to encourage passing out students to take up teaching jobs. Regional languages should be promoted in these institutes. It would go a long way towards attracting local talent. India's strength is in its diversity and language plays a big role.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

While implementing public private partnership, the Government has to think very seriously about it. It may create hurdle for the poor people. Brain drain occurs due to lack of opportunities and less remuneration. So, not only employment opportunities will have to be created but more salary also. The Bill with a very good intention gives more and more opportunities to the students who want to go for engineering and particularly, information technology.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I think it is the first time in the country that educational institutions are coming up in public private partnership through legislation. Through this Bill, we are now going to empower these institutes to grant degrees so that the degrees can be accepted through a statute. I think it would be better if private partners get a level-playing field in making decisions. I am happy to note that the reservation system will be implemented in these institutions. I am happy to see from the Bill that the Government is going to give scholarships and also going to fund the institutes for the benefit of economically backward students and also meritorious students. But, I would like to know whether funding by the Government is limited only to five years. I hope that the Government will permit us to submit our proposal and sanction one institute to the State of Telangana. We need one institute under this new Act for our new State of Telangana in my constituency Karimnagar.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I think this Bill will have far-reaching implication in the field of higher education, particularly the engineering education in our country. I strongly object to the reduction in the number of reserved seats in these institutions. A recent report which appeared in the newspaper said that in 2017 itself nine per cent drop out has happened in IIITs. They are mainly from the reserved categories. The vacancies reserved for teaching faculty in the IIITs are still not filled up. The Government is going to move their control completely and hand over these institutions to the private market. That will not help our future generation. I request the Government to rethink and re-frame the entire Bill and give adequate representation in teaching faculty and student seats in these institutions so that we can create more engineering students and more responsible persons in the engineering filed in the future. We produce more than eight lakh engineering students every year but the unemployment in the engineering sector is 60 per cent. I request the Government to give utmost importance to creating jobs.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are talking about these institutions at a time when this industry is going through a major crisis. Everywhere there are retrenchments in the IT industry. I doubt whether these Indian Institutes of Information Technology which are intended for IT will have any future because the content of information technology always has a short shelf life. Therefore, I am of the strong opinion, there should be an intensive training on the robotics or artificial intelligence. These are the ones which definitely have an edge over the routine information technology. Therefore, robotics, artificial intelligence, divergent and unconventional things of IT industry should also be a part of this curriculum. Instead of making IT industry a job seeker, let us make it as entrepreneurs so that they can provide jobs to the youth. We should always remember IT industry as a revolution. In Kakinada an IIIT was inaugurated five year back. It has just stopped there only. I would request the hon.Minister to look into the matter as to why this has been stopped and request him to rejuvenate it. I would request him to give top priority to new things allotted to Andhra Pradesh and give some academic importance to Andhra Pradesh on the Indian map.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In principle, I oppose this concept of having public private partnership in higher education sector. I fully agree with the hon.Minister that it is a necessity and urgency. We have already commenced 15 IIITs. To confer the statutory status to these educational institutions is need of the hour. But, the only point is that this IIIT should give access to the poor children belonging to BPL and the common people of this country. In Clause 3, sub-Clause (b), the 'Board' in relation to any Institute means "the Board of Governors referred to in sub-Section(1) of Section 14." This is not a pure and clear definition in Clause. My next point is this. This is a self-financing institute. I agree with this 50:35:15 ratio. But, the capital expenditure will be borne by the Government of India for five years. Subsequent to the said five years, who will finance these institutes? Definitely, it will be a self-financing institute. What is the fate of the Self-financing institute? I can share my experience in my State. We have started self-financing colleges and engineering colleges are started like anything. Now, the hon.High Court has come to a verdict that most of the colleges have a result of less than 10 per cent and the entire higher education scenario is in peril. Resources have to be found within the organization. That means the fees will be very high and the poor children or the poor students will not be able to afford the fee structure.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Through this Bill, certain Indian Institutes of Information Technology established under public-private partnership are proposed to be declared as Institutions of National Importance. The main objective is to develop new knowledge in information technology and to provide manpower of global standards. These IIIT are being empowered to award degrees. This will enhance the prospects of the graduating students in the job market. I welcome the government's decision to set up an IIIT in Andhra Pradesh. The autonomy provided to develop its own academic programmes including curriculum, new courses and method of assessment will help in meeting the student aspirations and industry requirements. The number of PhDs produced in India is small when compared to the vast population. India is also gaining prominence in terms of intellectual's capital with several global IT firms setting up their innovation in the country. In view of the recent initiatives taken by US and certain other countries our IT industry is getting affected and thereby many of our software professional's jobs are at risk and majority of these professionals belong to the Telugu states. I request the government to take steps to address their concerns and take up the issue with appropriate authorities. Though we have made progress in setting up institutions of higher learning they are not able to cope up with the growing population. However, to be able to lift a population of 450 million out of poverty and to have them participate in the country's economic development, higher education needs to be a priority.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today knowledge is power. I am very proud that I am coming from Karnataka where the famous engineer, Shri M. Visvesvaraya has contributed much for the country's development since before Independence in the field of technology. I am proud to say that the Visvesvaraya Technological University is there which caters to the needs of the entire Karnataka. Today it is one of the famous institutes. It was a self-financing institute under the State Government. Now we are going in for public-private partnership. I request the hon.Minister for HRD and the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of the University. Engineering students should not become job seekers; they should become job creators. Under the hon.Prime Minister's dream initiative of 'Make in India' plenty of opportunities are available for engineers today. So, they should go for manufacturing sector. There are other areas like naval base, agriculture and food processing which offer plenty of opportunities for the engineers. I once again congratulate the hon.Prime Minister and the HRD Minister for introducing a Bill relating to IIITs. These 15 Institutes should be recognized at the world level for their excellence. They should give better service to India and to the world.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Amendment Bill concerns with our industry and economy. We have to give opportunity to everyone by linking skill development to human resource. Skilled workers and labourers are the backbone of our country and our economy as well. We have to give more importance to skill knowledge instead of degrees. We have to strengthen our rural economy by giving opportunities to the poor and this can be done by the Centre, States and private sector together. Our population has been increasing, therefore, it would be better for us to promote IIITs to boost our economy.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A proposal was passed on 7 December, 2010 by the Union Cabinet announcing 20 IIITs to be started under the public-private partnership but only 15 IIITs started functioning out of them. But these institutes are not empowered to grant degrees. A provision to this effect has been made in this Bill for which I congratulate the hon.Minister. I would request that one IIIT should also be set up in Kolhapur. Kolhapur is also an industrial hub as many big companies like the Kirlosker, Raymonds are based there. If we open such an institute there it would create job opportunity for 20-25 thousand people.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill would take IIITs to a new level. I would like to know whether the Government is going to make provisions through which even the students belonging to the poor section of the society would be able to study in these industry supported institutes. I would also like to know as to under which model the government envisage to develop the infrastructure and mobilize the funds if we are to set up 20 such institutes in the country even though 35 per cent of this stake would be shared by the Government. I would also like to know from the hon.Minister whether the large industries which are going to contribute 15 per cent stake will be forced to go for the development of technology.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The resources of public institutions are limited in the field of higher education. Under such circumstances, the participation of private entities is absolutely essential so that good quality education could be imparted as per the requirement of the modern needs. The Bhagalpur Engineering College is going to start the registration of the batch for the year 2017-18 under which only two subjects are going to be offered. The registration of only 60 students has been made. I would like to request that sanction may be accorded for the registration of three hundred students as has been proposed by the State Government and the study of four subjects should be started in the college.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to state that this addition of this PPP mode in the Indian Institutes of Information Technology is adding to the overall eco- system of information technology and software services in our country and also the capability for building human capital that is required in the 21st century. In the North-Eastern States, the investment ratio today is at 57.5 by the Central Government, 35 per cent by the State Government and 7.5 per cent by the private entity. We would request that this be changed to 82.5 per cent from the Central Government, 10 per cent from the State Government and 7.5 per cent from the private entity.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to know from the government as to what is the role of the private institutions which are involved in it. What benefits will they get? In what way we will be benefited by their participation. So my request to the Central Government is that either the stake of the Central Government should be increase or the stake of the State Government be decreased. In the recent scenario, thousands of IT graduates are jobless. An info park or a techno park should be set up in the same institution in which they study so that they can be given the information of placement and training there.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are four objectives of this Bill. Firstly, to give national importance to the institutes. Secondly, the sanction for setting up the institutes under the PPP mode. Thirdly, the Bill is geared towards opening new streams of knowledge by establishing these institutes. Fourthly, the Bill is also oriented in the direction of preparing manpower as per the global requirements of the industry. The setting up of the institutes of national importance will increase employability in the country. If we talk in terms of the four top IT companies of the country they spend about Rs.1723 crore annually on training. If the expenditure meant for training of the candidates is done through institutes and if the training is imparted through the same institutes then it is going to save upto six months to one year of time of the students which they have to waste after finishing their education. By this view point, this Bill is a commendable step.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bill is silent whether the institute will have to implement reservation for SC,ST and OBC in faculty recruitment. That needs to be clarified. I would draw the attention of the hon.Minister that out of 15 lakh engineering graduates coming out every year, just about 10 per cent graduates are employable. As per Mckinsey Report by 2025, 14 lakh middle level work force in IT industry accounting for 45 per cent of the total work force as of now will face an uncertain future. There is clash about anti-outsourcing in America and Europe. Keeping the prevailing circumstances in mind the Government will have to work with a new mindset.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to thank the government for envisaging the setting up of 20 IITs on PPP mode keeping in view the national requirements and also the prevailing circumstances at the national and international level. I find that there is a great disparity between the requirement of the industry and our educational system. This Bill is going to fill this gap. I would certainly like to say that such institutes will certainly be able to churn out the technicians, in both qualitative and quantitative terms to match the pace and requirement of the progress being made in the country under the Make in India programme. It is for the first time that 15 such institutes are being set up in the country. Today our institutes are not research oriented and if we make them research oriented then certainly it will be a useful step for the country. I would like the government to make a provision under which it is made obligatory upon the IITians to serve for atleast 10-15 years in the country before migrate to foreign countries and a bond to this effect could be made to sign by them. The existing 24 institutes should be linked to the institutions like DRDO, ISRO etc. to benefit these institutes. There is a need to establish defence institutes in Ujjain also.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I demand from the Government that an IT hub should be set up in Punjab because if the students from Punjab are able to get a placement in their State then they won't require to go abroad. The previous government had announced for setting up of an IT park but it could not beyond it. There is a need to take steps to check brain drain from India.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill provides opportunity of investment to the private sector. Under such circumstances how will the students belonging to the poor and middle class families will be able to afford the fee of such institutes. Therefore, there is a need for providing fee concession to the meritorious students and those belonging to the middle class. Unless the government pays attention to the real tenant this Bill meant for IIITs is not going to serve its purpose. I would urge the government to bring in cooperative sector under the ambit of the Bill. When the government is bringing PPP system why can't it go for cooperative system? I would urge that atleast five IITs should be set up in Bihar.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill will give a boost to higher education throughout India. In Punjab, there is acute shortage of high quality information technology hubs. So, we need such hubs in Punjab. There are certain shortcomings in IIT. These shortcomings must be removed by the Central Government. Students who study in these institutes of higher learning, often join the jobs in foreign multi-national companies abroad. It leads to acute brain-drain. I urge upon the government to evolve such a system where it is made compulsory for students to work in one's own country and State for the first 5 to 10 years. The states and our country will gain out of it. Students belonging to the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes are generally not in a condition to shell out one to one and half lakh rupees as fees. Scholarships and fee-exemptions should be granted to the SC & ST students too, so that they can study in IITs etc. The scholarship system needs to be * Original in Punjabi revamped in the Engineering Colleges. Scholarship system must be streamlined in all states, especially Punjab.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill. One of the Objectives of this Bill is to provide manpower of global standards. Though our IT professionals are highly paid, still they are relatively paid less compared to their western counterparts. If there is any stress in the industry and layoffs, then the first victims are the Indian IT professionals. It is because mechanical engineers work in the field of mechanical engineering; electrical engineers work in the field of electrical engineering; civil engineers work in the field of construction; but IT engineers and IT professionals work in different fields. Therefore, there is a need for not just exposure to programming, but a need for social science, liberal arts, performing arts, and all these other arts. Many Members have said that we should introduce robotics, artificial intelligence and other new technologies, but more important than that is to introduce social sciences in the IIITs.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I want to thank the entire House. As many as 25 Members have participated in the discussion but all have supported the Bill. Earlier, there were only four IIITs and now the fifth one is being established at Kurnul. We have to go for public-private partnership for further expansion. There is apprehension that this will lead to exorbitant hike in fees but this fear is unfounded. We have made much progress in the field of software but there is a lot to do in the field of hardware. We have made neither Google nor Facebook nor Twitter nor Windows. Our talents are doing all these in foreign countries but they are working for others. Therefore, we must attract back the best of the best talents. That is why a call for Make-in-India has been given. The world is changing fast. We need modern education and institutes of national importance and this Bill has been brought with this objective. We need everybody's participation in this. So, we should not undermine the importance of private partnership. Indian Institute of Sciences is conducting experiments in nano technology. One laboratory has cost Rs.250 crore. Another centre has to be set up at a cost of Rs.3000 crore. But we should certainly make such investment because we have already lost some opportunity. Now, we should not miss any revolution. Talents are there in all classes of society. Smart India Hackathon was organized last time. Around 42,000 students from more than 2000 engineering colleges participated in Hackathon.We should try to provide best facilities to the professionals and attract them back. They are coming back as well. Somebody had said that unemployment is growing in IT sector but this is not fact. Mr. Chandrashekar, head of TCS and the NASCOM, both estimated that 70 lakh new employments will be generated in IT sector alone. An off campus IIIT of IIIT, Allahabad was set up at Amethi in the year 2005 but not a single faculty was appointed there. The students staged an agitation demanding their transfer to their main institute at Allahabad. We only fulfilled the demand of these students and set up a college of Ambedkar University in that building which is functioning well catering to thousands of students of Amethi and Sultanpur districts. The state should also allocate funds for education. Those who can afford to pay will have to pay hiked fees but there is scholarship scheme for poor students. The students should get good education so that they can make progress. Good education and good institute increase employability. We are doing all out efforts to fill up the vacancies in all the institutes. The other thing is that the institute of higher education should get autonomy. IIITs are functional in Manipur and at Guwahati in North East. All the rules relating to reservation are followed. I welcome the suggestions of all the hon.Members. Education is not a subject of party politics but a subject of nation building. We all should work together in this direction. I thank all the hon.Members for supporting this Bill. The Bill was passed.
