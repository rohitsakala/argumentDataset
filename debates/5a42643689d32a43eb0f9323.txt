I have to inform the House the that I have receive seven notices of adjournment motion from Shri Mallikarjun Kharge and others regarding "Action taken by the Government on the reported involvement and admission of the Union Minister and related acts and actions in assisting a fugitive and stand taken by the Government in this regard." Shri Mallikarjun Kharge has given notice at first point of time. I have accordingly allowed Shri Mallikarjun Kharge to move the motion.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I seek the leave of the House for moving the adjournment motion regarding action taken by the Government on the reported involvement and admission of the Union Minister and related acts and actions in assisting a fugitive and stand taken by the Government in this regard.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As the leave is not opposed, the leave is granted.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am thankful to you as my adjournment motion has been accepted after so many days. Had this proposal been accepted four weeks ago it would have been better. I appeal that the Prime Minister should be present in the House during the course of this discussion. The Minister of External Affairs has supported a fugitive. We want that the Prime Minister should come to the House, listen to and reply this debate. The Minister of External Affairs is repeatedly saying that she has done no wrong, she has not written letter to anyone. She had helped that person even after knowing each and every thing about him. Lalit Modi did not appear before the Enforcement Directorate even being asked frequently by the Government of India to do so as a result of which his passport was also cancelled. Why does the Government not took the case of Lalit Modi to the Supreme Court. The seven questions asked by my party under RTI Act were also not replied to. There are sixteen cases of economic offence pending against the Lalit Modi. We want to know on what ground Minister of External Affairs try to helped Lalit Modi. If you want to help anyone that should be done under the law of the land. The Minister had said that she had asked the British Government to provide travel document to Lalit Modi on humanitarian grounds. It is against the law as humanitarian approach and law are two different things. Hon.Minister of External Affairs herself has admitted that she had done so. That is why, we are demanding her resignation. She had said that it would not affect the bilateral ties of the two countries whereas the UPA Government had warned the UK Government that if they gave travel documents, it could impact our relations. If the Minister of External Affairs of India says to the High Commissioner of UK that giving travel documents to someone would not impact our relations, what is this if not the recommendation? What the Government is terming as humanitarian ground, was at serial No.3 in his list that he had to visit her ailing wife in Portugal and his presence was necessary there. The Government could ask him to return to India afterwards but she only keeps saying that she did not do anything wrong. After availing travel documents, he first went to Portugal then to Vienna and then to other places for relaxing in resorts and she calls it help on humanitarian ground. The Government could say that if he had to go to Portugal for eight days, he could go and return directly. When a division bench of High Court altered the decision of cancellation of passport of Shri Lalit Modi, who decided not to appeal in the Supreme Court against this decision? Was ED consulted on this subject on the initiative of which his passport was cancelled? Who had taken a decision to issue a new passport to Shri Lalit Modi? Passport is only a travel document. One needs to have visa or permit of the country to stay there. Did the Government of India raise its objection with the UK Government as to how visa or residency permit was given to Shri Lalit Modi for long stay? Shri Lalit Modi possesses an Indian passport. He is an Indian citizen as per Indian law. The ED has given him a new passport after issuing the summon, the Government needs to tell the House as to what steps it has taken in this matter. Shri Lalit Modi has said that there is a threat to his life if he returns to India. Is the Government not able to secure an Indian citizen's life who is supposed to appear before the ED? The Prime Minister can respond to all these questions. Therefore we are demanding here in this House that the Minister of Foreign Affairs should resign on moral grounds for her direct or indirect involvement in it. THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND MINISTER OF

At the very outset, I would like to convey my sincere thanks to you for acceding to my request and also to accepting the Adjournment Motion after taking the sense of the House. We all heard the leader of the Congress party with rapt attention. Now, I simply expect from him that he should also listen to me in the same way. The Leader of the Congress Party has alleged that I am involved in it and that I have also admitted it. I have repeatedly said that I have done no wrong. The statement which he is terming as my admission, has been made by me in this House stating that a woman who is a citizen of India and suffering from cancer for the last 17 years and who has committed no crime and against whom there is no case registered. If helping such a woman is crime then I have committed this crime. This was never under my consideration to facilitate granting of travel documents to Mr. Lalit Modi. What was under my consideration was that if the British Government decides to grant him travel documents then it would not adversely impact our bilateral relations. Thereupon, I verbally conveyed the message to the British Authorities that it will not adversely impact our bilateral relations. Accordingly, the British Government granted the travel documents to Mr. Lalit Modi in accordance with their rules. Then how come this remains an issue? It has also been alleged that my family members are his counsels and that is why it is a matter of conflict of interest. I would like to say that my husband was not his counsel in the passport case. As far as my daughter is concerned, she was a junior counsel at no. 9 in the list of counsels. In fact, the real issue of conflict of interest had cropped up when Shri P. Chidambaram was Minister of Finance and his wife was appointed as an advocate by the Department of Income Tax. The issue of conflict of interest emerged again when Shri P. Chidambaram was Minister of Finance and his wife accepted rupees one crore to stand as an advocate in the Sardha scam, though he as Minister of Finance was examining the file of the Sardha scam. Therefore, there is no conflict of interest in my case. Shri Kharge ji has raised seven questions. But before answering these questions, I would like to respond to the Vice President of the Congress party who has made a statement against me outside the House. He has alleged that I have committed a criminal offence by favouring a fugitive. However, no court has declared Lalit Modi as an absconder or fugitive. This has also been alleged that I have close family links with him. That is why I extended the help to him. Besides, he has alleged that whatever I have done, I have done secretly. I would like to make it categorical that I have done nothing secretly. If at all anything was done secretly it was done by the then Congress Government to let Quatrochchi escape from the country. Again if anything was done secretly, it was done to let Anderson escape from the country. I would like to say to the Congress Vice President that he should study the history of his family right from Quatrochchi to Shahryar. I would also like to tell him that I did not indulge in quid pro quo, rather it was Shri Chidambaram who bypassed MEA and continued corresponding with Chancellor of Exchequer. It came to the light only when the MEA received reply in thereof under protocol. The Chancellor of Exchequer advised him to send a request for his extradition as there was no way of his deportation. Consequently, the image of the country suffered a dent to such an extent that they did not deem it fit even to reply to his letter. Mr. Kharge ji has asked me how Lalit Modi got the right of residency. I want to tell him that he got it when the Congress Party was in power. Then he has also asked me why an appeal was not filed? Who is responsible for that? Appeal could not be filed because the then Government had only issued a show cause notice. For four years no action was taken on it due to which his passport was returned. When the present Minister of Finance took charge, he initiated action on it. I have been in politics for the last 38 years. Not even a single charge has been leveled against me. But on the issue of Lalit Modi the Congress Leadership was divided at that time. One group wanted action against Lalit Modi, the other did not. The group which wanted action against him was led by the then Shri Chidambaram himself. However, he was alone in this. Hence, he did not follow the procedure. Had the extradition request been made, it would have come to light. Thus due to personal enmity he adopted the path of deportation for Lalit Modi and even today he is misleading.

In India, sporting fraternity needs more support for development as we have a population of more than 125 crores. It is a pride moment for all of us when we say Grand Master Viswanathan Anand remains the king in the field of Chess. It is pertinent to say here that besides Cricket, all other sports such as Kabaddi, Hockey, Football, Chess, Badminton, Tennis, Wrestling, etc. should be given equal importance. For infrastructure development and for encouraging sports activities, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, hon.Amma had constructed world-class Nehru Stadium, motivating sportspersons, granting funds and extending housing facilities for them. Our view is that whosoever committed mistake in the IPL Scam should be punished, however high and mighty he may be. The public of this country has a feeling that the cricket matches played under the banner of IPL are being misused for their own benefit, to amass wealth, and to convert black money into white. It appears that Lalit Modi has misused the travel documents to visit foreign countries. He has diverted a lot of ill-gotten money, absconded himself and went abroad and settled. The Government should take stringent action against him. The people of the country want some concrete action. The sports bodies should be free from politics. I sincerely hope that the Government would take appropriate action in the future so that IPL is free from controversies and corruption charges.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I personally feel whenever it comes to corruption, TMC and our leader Mamta Banerjee has always been found to be fighting that. There is another issue of Vyapam. TMC have also given notices of Adjournment Motion on that issue, which is equally serious, and people also want certain clarifications. We do not live by the legality. We live by the perception of the people of the country also. The biggest court for us is the people of India. I just hope and pray that in future we will have the debates which the people of this country want to listen.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yesterday, we saw that famous enactment of Chanakya and one thing struck me. That statement was: "Do not be committed to a person; do not be committed to a family; be committed to the nation." The onus lies with us to go through the Report and Action Taken Note which the Standing Committee on Finance had submitted. The Finance Committee of our Parliament took it up. And we the parliamentarians are entrusted to protect the interest of the people here. It is corruption which goes into the body politic to make our democracy weak and it is corruption which actually weakened our intelligence. We have greater challenges to meet in this world. We had to fight against hunger; we have to fight against poverty; and we have to fight against those people who are eating into the basic structure of our democracy. Here is a case which needs appropriate action from the Government side and appropriate action has just started. I would also express my Party's viewpoint that we are against corruption and corruption is before us. We have to fight it out for the benefit of this nation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the beginning, hon.External Affairs Minister has been stating that she is ready to give statement regarding the matter which is in limelight in media and newspapers. Opposition is very well aware of sort of statement she is capable of giving regarding the issue and so in order to prevent her from giving the statement they are engaging in ruckus behaviour. Besides, references of Chief Ministers of states should not be made here in this House. I have been member of this House for 20 years and we all know about the External Affairs Minister. If a person sitting here tries to cast an aspersion on her despite knowing her then he will belie himself. We too had created uproar when CAG report was presented with regard to 2G spectrum allocation. Then everything was against then government. Today, people have not even left him to become a Leader of Opposition here. This entire Monsoon Session is a wash out now. It is my opinion that these people do not have even right to be called public representative in actual sense. We on behalf of our party wholeheartedly support the External Affairs Minister and oppose this motion.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If this entire Session is a wash out, then a cumulative amount of about Rs.260 crore would have gone for a complete waste. The allegations leveled against the hon.External Affairs Minister Shrimati Sushmaji are absolutely baseless and she has justified her stance on the floor of the House. The fact of the matter is that when the IPL scam broke there was absolutely nothing that UPA Government did to stop the individual in question from escaping to Britain. No cases were filed against him and it is only under the current Government that recently court orders have been issued for his arrest. I would just like to request you not to allow one party to hijack the proceedings of the House. I would request the Opposition to let the House to function smoothly so that pressing issues of all the Members can be discussed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When we look at the hon.External Affairs Minister then I cannot imagine that she may have committed any mistake ever. On humanitarian grounds she said that if it does not cause any problem to you country, you can do it. But it is very unfortunate that a sport like cricket which is played and watched by all groups of people from children to sixty-year olds with such a pleasure and enjoyment can be tarnished and destroyed by some mala fide interests. This is not in the spirit of the game. We must protect and defend the sanity of the sports which we as a nation are so passionate about. As an individual I feel that suitable action should be taken against the accused in a time bound manner. In this direction, the Enforcement Directorate has served 16 show-cause notices on Lalit Modi for alleged contraventions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. A non-bailable warrant has also been issued under Prevention of Money Laundering Act. So, I would just like to say that the BCCI should consider administrative reforms that clearly safeguard its practices and procedures.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Government was not ready and our adjournment notices were disallowed. We are not responsible because no adjournment notice was allowed by the Government or the Speaker. The proposal has to be taken by the Prime Minister. In democracy, the Government is accountable to the Parliament and the Parliament is accountable to the people. The question now is not the allegation or criticism of a person. The Ministers are bound to abide by the Constitution. Here the main issue is of breaking the standard protocol by our hon.Minister of External Affairs. The Minister of External Affairs had told the British High Commissioner in New Delhi that if the British Government chose to give travel documents to the then IPL Chief that would not spoil our bilateral relations. So, this is a violation that the Minister has made. I would like to know whether this decision was taken with the knowledge of the Prime Minister or whether it was discussed in the Cabinet. It is said that the action was taken on the basis of the humanitarian aspect. Of course, we have to think on the humanitarian ground. As a Minister she should ask him to go to the Indian High Commission or to the British High Commission. Papers have to be processed from there and then it should come to the Ministry. From the Ministry it should go to the Cabinet and then a decision should be taken. But how can a Minister alone take this decision? So, this is a very serious issue. My Party demand that there should be an investigation on this issue.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When we commit a mistake or a wrong thing, whether anybody knows it or not, our conscience knows it and we always feel guilty about it. We, 543 people, are representing 125 crore people. It is the greatest country. Therefore, we should be a model to the people of our country. Our regional Party feels everything should be debated and everything should be investigated if there is anything wrong. Everybody preaches morals but we never follow them. Depending on the merits of the case, let us decide and not just because somebody has leveled allegations against anyone. Let everything be thoroughly investigated and the case be decided on its merits.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There has been deadlock in the House on the question of the Adjournment Motion. The democratic, human and moral values got bypassed following a deadlock in the House. The country has several important issues before it like the ones relating to employment, farmers and sugarcane growers. But the Opposition did not allow us to speak on these very important issues. The Hon.Minister of External Affairs has acted legally in the case in question. Therefore, I oppose the Adjournment Motion.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This issue is being hotly debated at all places. Therefore, there is a need for us to ponder over this issue very seriously. Arguments alone are not going to serve any purpose because morality in public life is a very important thing. Whenever such occasions arise we should keep the dignity of our nation utmost in our mind because such kind of incidents have happened one after another and they have in no way enhanced the dignity of our country. I will say this much only that if such kind of question mark is put on our public life, it would be better for us to exonerate ourselves of the same. Therefore, it is high time for us to introspect.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our party came into existence out of anti- corruption movement and we have always been raising our voice against any kind of corruption. A serious economic offender against whom light blue corner notice has been issued and who has been involved in money laundering worth crore of rupees is residing in a foreign country and that country has restricted his exit outside the country. The Hon.Minister of External Affairs has been saying that she has tried to help him on the humanitarian ground. If it is so then why the Government is not helping out lakhs of farmers on humanitarian grounds who are committing suicides almost on daily basis. The poor and the backward people are dying daily for want of proper treatment. Will the Government treat them as humans? 41 Indians are missing in Iraq. The Governments should show some sympathy towards these people also. Finally, I would like to say that the Government should take stern action in this case.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This issue is having a mighty dimension. Nepotism and abuse of power by the External Affairs Minister, violation of rules from the Government side, making a safe haven for an economic offender are before us. The head of the government is behaving as a silent spectator to all these things. It is quite unfortunate. There is every reason to believe that this Government had a soft corner with Lalit Modi. That, perhaps, might have inspired him to do these kinds of things. Even now, a Foreign Exchange violation case against a Rajasthan-based firm said to be owned by him which involved alleged illegal routing of Rs.21 crore from Mauritius-based company is there. The Enforcement Directorate has begun probe. This kind of corruption case will have to be treated very seriously.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to support the adjournment motion but I am stunned that after disrupting the House for so many days, the Congress party has ultimately decided to go for discussion and gave opportunity to the hon.Minister of External Affairs to put forth her views. What I feel is that the ultimate issue is the IPL. I have heard that a scam of 400 million dollars, in violation of the norms of RBI, FDI and IT has taken place. This money can be related to drugs even. The Government should reply as to what it is doing to bring back this 1365 crore rupees. Unfortunately, the hon.Minister of External Affairs has to clarify all these things in the House in such a hay. In Parliamentary Democracy, the hon.Prime Minister should have come to the House and say that I have full faith and trust on my Minister. But unfortunately, the hon.Minister has been left alone. I would like to know from the Government through you that the Dalits and the Muslims of the country against whom the case under Section-324 of IPC is lodged cannot get a passport. How will they get the passport? This is feudalism that the one who is acquainted with the hon.Minister of External Affairs, gets the passport. Therefore, I urge the Government to look into and check all the things.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I wanted to raise many important issues in this Monsoon Session but such circumstances were created that the 40 Members disrupted the Session in such a way that as a new Member I felt that in democracy, all the rights rest with the Opposition and the Ruling party does not have any. Ultimately, today this House has taken up the discussion. All the allegations have been discussed in detail and thereafter the saying that much ado about nothing has come true. It is good that this discussion has completed today only and the entire country has come to know that the Congress party was opposing merely to oppose and there was no content in their allegations. One of the hon.Members was saying that the hon.Prime Minister did not come to protect. May be, you require it but our Minister is competent enough to protect herself.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Be that our colleagues from the Congress party or the BJP have washed out the entire Monsoon Session. Chaudhary Devi Lal used to say that in democracy, sentiments of the people should be taken care of. I feel that during the entire Monsoon Session each Member of this House did not care for the sentiments of the people and was concerned about governance only. Our colleagues from the Congress claim that corruption has taken place. I would like to know that in Haryana the CLU of 73 acres of land was sold but why any discussion on that in the House has not taken place on it as on date? The hon.Minister of External Affairs, in her reply has said that our Government has issued a Red Corner Notice. I urge that when this Red Corner Notice has been issued, then Lalit Modi should be brought back and punished. During the last 12-13 days, the fact that IPL has taken place, came to light. I urge that there are a number of people involved in this IPL scam against whom inquiry should be conducted and a committee should be constituted so that the truth may prevail.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are having high esteems to the hon.External Affairs Minister and we appreciate the performance which she has made during this time as the External Affairs Minster. In order to uphold the principles of democracy. I humbly demand the resignation of the hon.External Affairs Minister at the earliest. The hon.External Affairs Minister has challenged whether there is any proof or evidence to substantiate any charge against her. I take and accept the challenge. The UK Government rules does not prevent in giving the travel documents to Lalit Modi. Why is it being prevented? It is because the former UPA Government had given a letter that if you assist Mr. Lalit Modi that will definitely affect our relationship. My second point is from the Constitution. The hon.Minister has lost the authority to hold the office of the External Affairs Minister. She has violated the Constitutional obligation of Oath of Office.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to speak on behalf of the Janshakti Party. The fact is that what I am witnessing after coming here in Parliament, I never felt so sorry in the past. I hoped that talks can solve big problems. Only 40 persons make it such a big issue that the country will not go ahead without settling these issues Sushma Ji is such a personality that I have always supported her. Being a young politician I have heard so many speeches of Sushma Ji on 'Youtube' and got inspiration from these speeches. If any person says that Sushma Ji has done anything wrong in her 38 year long political career, nobody will believe it. I request this House to understand this, there are so many issues. Every Member needs to present his point of view. SHRI RAHUL GANDHI: Hon'ble Prime Minister had made a promise to the nation that every bank account in the country would receive 15 lakh rupees. Now I want to speak about that but I am not being allowed to speak. But the Congress Party would not be silent and would continue to speak. Several people do humanitarian works. But Sushma Ji, the Minister of External Affairs is the first humanitarian in the world who keeps her humanitarian works in secret. Today efforts were being made to cover a Member of Parliament by several other Members of Parliament. 12 crore rupees were provided to his company. I want to know what benefit Lalit Modi got from the said commercial transaction. The country wants to knows as to why Lalit Modi and the black money network are being protected. It is not in the interest of the country. THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, MINISTER OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today the entire country was expecting that the Opposition, during the discussion on the adjournment motion will give some powerful points. But it has not been so. The reality is that this issue had its genesis in the year 2009 when the IPL cricket tournament was shifted to South Africa because of the impending general election in the country. After the tournament, the Enforcement Directorate issued notice to some persons on the basis of the assumption that money had been transferred for this tournament without taking permission from RBI. In spite of the notices, that person did not appear for the investigation and ran away to London. The then UPA Government issued a Light Blue Corner alert to arrest that person. The case against that person was under the Foreign Exchange Management Act under which the maximum punishment that could be granted was fine and penalty. Under FEMA, there is no provision for any Red Corner Alert and there is no provision for any bailable or non-bailable warrant. Under FEMA one cannot be declared an absconder or a fugitive because one cannot be arrested. Now it is said that why the Government did not provide information under RTI whereas the truth is that the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI have been granted immunity and they need not give documents under RTI. Later on, the then Finance Minister wrote three letters to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England in which he stated we have cancelled his passport and ask as to why he is continuing to stay in England? The Chancellor replied that the person cannot be deported under the British law because for deportation there has to be some criminal case. The Chancellor also said that the only methodology that you have is that under our Extradition Law you apply for his extradition. Meanwhile the Delhi High Court delivered a judgement saying that his passport has been wrongly cancelled. Thus, the every step which you have taken when was in power was taken in the wrong direction. You have taken such steps with which you could never succeed. The right strategy was that you register a case under the PMLA, activate that case, summon him in the case, get a non-bailable warrant against him and move for a Red Corner Alert against him. These are all steps which will be taken now. Thus, you make a mountain of what is not even a molehill. Shri Rahul ji has recently asked whether the Government has taken action on the request of Shri Premchandran. The fact is that Sushma ji had replied on that request in October 2014. Thus, they have washed out the entire Session of the House on an issue which is not even a issue. The truth is you ran a failed Government. Therefore, when things are beginning to look up in India and there is a new confidence, you somehow want to sabotage the Indian growth story. Sushma ji is only a pretext. The real reason was that they wanted to prevent the legislation, particularly the Constitution amendment on the GST. It is very easy to say that her family members appeared in a case. She has clarified that her daughter appeared with her senior. There were nine other junior. Therefore, the Government reject each of these charges against. Likewise, they referred to the case of a Member of Parliament and his mother who happen to be the Chief Minister. The only offence which has been made there is that a loan by cheque was given in one year and it was returned in the next year. Likewise, a civil court has given its verdict that the palace belong to Shri Dushyant Singh. I do not want to express a final opinion on it because there is a complaint pending which will be investigated. That is all I have to say about it.

I agree that no Member should make any allegation against other Members or even important leaders. No Member has got a right to make allegations. I just inquired and I would like to tell you that there is nothing on record. If there is anything objectionable on record about anybody, it should be removed. I am not adding anything to the debate but as Parliamentary Affairs Minister, this is my responsibility. It has been painful to me for the last few days. The first is on account of Shrimati Sushma Swaraj an honest and best performing Minister, who is facing this sort of a totally negative propaganda. The second point is that I am a Parliamentary Affairs Minister. I called a meeting on the 20th. Forty-one political leaders of 29 political parties were present. At the end of the day, 28 parties said, the House should function. But, the Congress Party went on record saying that the House will not function unless the Ministers resign. On 3rd August, I called a meeting of Leaders of Opposition Parties and I assured them that as per the rules the Government is ready to discuss each and every issue. There also, Congress categorically stated, 'resignation first, discussion later'. On 10th , Mulayam Singh Ji, gave a suggestion to the hon.Speaker to call the Leaders and sort out the issue. You were kind enough to call many of the Leaders to your Chamber, including me. In the meeting they said, "Six Ministers of our Government were forced or made to resign. We are asking only for two Ministers". The people of the country has given a mandate to our leader, Shri Narendra Modi and to our Government. Let us argue, discuss, debate and decide but allow the Parliament to function. The Motion was negatived.
