Railways is one of the best organizations in the world. Modernisation process started was when Shri Madhavrao Scindiaji was the Railway Minister. He initiated a lot of modernization process. The next was Vision 2020 of the then Minister of Railways, hon.Mamata Banerjeeji. This Vision 2020 document covers everything. In this very Report of the Railway Convention Committee a lot of reference has been made to this Vision 2020. All of them have done very good work. The most capable people we can think of, are in the Railways. In order for an engineer to get an experience, his first preference would be the Railways. But what is happening today, and the crux of the Railways is its finances. I remember that when I was the Railway Minister, I had to borrow about Rs.3000 crore to put in to the Railway Development Fund. My point is that the Railways are not allowed to do whatever they want to do in terms of generating their own revenue. On top of it, if they have to pay interest as dividend on whatever capital the Railways get, it is impossible for any Railway Minister to move smoothly. The very basic point is, what are we going to do about the Railways? We have 30 years old projects. If we want to fulfil all these projects, then we require, perhaps, may be, Rs.5 lakh crore. The basic problem is the definition of the Railways. The Indian Railway is a departmental commercial undertaking of the Government of India. It was okay as long as it was under the British. That the British whatever penny they invested, they wanted the return out of it. Railway still is not free from this colonial legacy. I also want to suggest that as we have a national policy on Defence and National Policy on Foreign Affairs, why cannot we have a national policy on Indian Railways? So, my suggestion is that we must ensure that like all the other Ministry, Indian Railway belongs to India and Indian Railways cannot be treated as commercial entity. Nowhere in the world the Railways have the capacity to earn money and plough it back. China was about 15 years behind the Indian Railways 20-25 years back. Today they have gone so far that we cannot even make up. Japan took money from the World Bank at a very low interest rate. So, please understand that no Railways in the world can run in profit. The entire infrastructure has to be given by the Government and the time has come to have a national policy on railway because railway is a big asset.

Development of any area, particularly industrialization is impossible without the Railways. Odisha has been in an unfortunate condition in this regard. Many governments came but Odisha remained neglected in terms of railways. However, six railway projects have been sanctioned in Odisha this year through the efforts of our hon.Chief Minister and the hon.Minister of railways. For that I would like to thank both of them. There are a number of Railway projects in Odisha that are financially viable but have not been sanctioned as yet. All of these need to be sanctioned. Railways have to bear the loss of uneconomical lines due to social obligation. Railway has various social obligations and it has to bear the burden of unviable rail lines, strategic rail lines and coaching services. As far as various paras are concerned, in para 5, quantification work has been done with regard to strategic line which is also a national project, to assess the losses incurred. Recommendations have been made on the basis of such assessment. But with regard to para 6 which is related with social obligation and lot of contention between Financial Ministry and Railway Ministry is going on there. Railway is claiming that it is bearing the losses to the tune of Rs.30,000 crore rupees whereas Finance Ministry says that this amount has not been quantified. Finally, Convention Committee has stated in this regard that there is a need to quantify it scientifically. As far as dividend is concerned, there is a need to ponder over various issues related to it. Railway is paying dividend in perpetuity. In this regard I would like to say that a date should be fixed for other assets and after the lapse of that date dividend should not be paid. So, there is a need to scrutiny the whole process related to dividend so as to assess the amount and period of dividend to be given.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railway is a commercial institute and being a commercial institute it earns profit. Then it has to give dividend from that profit. First of all, we would have to endeavour for increasing the revenue of the railways. Why passenger revenue is declining today? Why the number of passenger is reducing day by day? In Mumbai, local train has become a lifeline here. But condition is day by day worsening in Mumbai. There is no need to provide wi-fi or bullet train here instead we should ensure the timely operation of trains. Passengers are never given information by the PR people from the Railways whereas Convention Committee is thinking of giving dividend. There is a need to strengthen the rail services. Railway should improve the design of rail coaches. We can provide various amenities to these people. All this innovative steps are commendable. But at the same time the services right now is in use should work efficiently and nicely. In addition to that, Railway has a huge land asset which is largely encroached upon. In this regard, policy should be made not only by the railways but also by the Union Government. Railway should use this land commercially and explore all ideas and see to it that it is really interested in that. Similarly, ticketless travelling should be discouraged. I feel that there is no need to provide dividend at all. Instead government should use the whole money on the development of rail services.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Government Resolution is with regard to the Railway Convention Committee 2014. There is no need of having any objection to it because the dividend goes in favour of the labourers. However, we have experienced that the dividend payable every year is declining because of inflation. Also, there is no budgetary support for the Railways. So, Railway has to make its own revenue. It is in the form of charges on passengers and parcel. But the railway has a very huge infrastructure to pay for the new lines, new trains, new platforms, salaries to the workers and so on. As a result, the Railways is not able to invest much on new projects which could generate new income. It is because it has to fulfill its social obligation of providing passenger facilities. The second issue which I would like to point out is the facilities and conveniences that the passengers need. There should be a time-bound programme as far as the Railways in concerned. I would also request the Government that schemes pertaining to Kerala be taken up on a priority basis. Moreover, the State Governments have very little say in the decision making process of Railways. I now come to the Rakesh Mohan Committee report. The report says that there is no need of a Railway Budget, no need of a scrutiny and there is no need of any discussion at all. That we cannot accept. It is really a symbol of communal harmony in the country. The Railways should not implement the recommendations of the Rakesh Mohan Committee. If it does, it would go purely on the path of privatization. At the same time, public participation should be kept in mind because the Railways has a social obligation. One point I would press on is that the Government should reserve some amount for the Railways to continue the dividend.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railway have the responsibility to fulfill its social obligation. Today government is committed towards providing security in railways. In this regard, Railway has made a proposal to appoint 3000 women security personnel. Along with that there is a proposal to spend huge amount on cleanliness also. Under the able leadership of our hon.Prime Minister, Railway Minister has taken initiative to give importance to the whole country. I would like to compliment our hon.Prime Minister for introducing rail services in Tripura for the first time after Independence. Government have also implemented 353 projects across the country. I would like to extend my gratitude to the hon.Prime Minister and the Minister of Railways for providing Rs.2179 crore for the railway line passing from Khalilabad to Balrampur via Medaval, Bausi, Utraula and Shrawasti. I would like to state one more thing about the Resolution of Railway that we spend billions of rupees on education and health care to meet the social obligations but these two Departments do not pay dividends. It stands to be our duty to meet the social obligations. Hence, given the social obligations associated with Railways, dividend should not be taken from it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The principle of the Railways is that the tax payer is literally the owner of the Indian Railways. Since it is a commercial organization, it has to be run efficiently and in a professional manner unlike a non-commercial organization. The Government of India provides Gross Budgetary Support to the Indian Railways to the tune of Rs.40,000 crore every year. So, the net effect is that whatever the Railways pay as dividend to the Government of India is less than 3 per cent. It is high time that the Railways should pay a dividend as much as possible as is paid by some other Public Sector Undertakings. All the projects pending not only in West Bengal but also in Andhra Pradesh should be completed. The Railway Board has requested for the waiver of the dividend from this year onwards. It is extremely unfair on the part of the Railway Board to ask for a waiver because Government of India also needs funds. As per the States Reorganization Act of Andhra Pradesh after the formation of Telangana, it had been declared that Vizag would be given a separate Railway Zone. So, a Railway Zone along with special status should be given to Andhra Pradesh.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The progress and the development of India is dependent on railway. Let me come to the problems pertaining to railway being faced by my state Punjab. It contributes over 60% foodgrains in the centra kitty. Foodgrains are transported from Punjab to various states with the help of railway network. So, railway plays a crucial role as far as Punjab is concerned. However, much is yet to be done as far as the railway infrastructure in Punjab is concerned. Step-motherly treatment was meted out of Punjab by erstwhile Governments. My Parliamentary constituency is Ferozepur. No Shatabdi train links Delhi and Feozepur. A promise was made that a Shatabdi train will ply on this route. But to no avail. Trains must be provided that link Punjab to Haridwar, Nanded Sahib and other religious places. Talwandi Sahib is a holy place of the Sikhs. A four-lane road connectivity between Amritsar and Talwandi Shaib is the need of the hour. However, there is no underpass or overbridge at Talwandi town. When the gates are closed, it leads to massive jams. The Fazilka-Jalandhar DMU train has only one coach. At least five coaches mush be provided for this train. No toilet facility has been provided for passengers in this train. It becomes difficult for the commuters, especially women and children. So, toilet facility must be provided in this train.

Today, the Railway is an important means of transport for common men, middle class and the higher class of our society in India. We have observed that new railway lines are announced to be laid with every new Rail Budget in the country but hardly any headway is made on the earlier announcements till the Budget is presented for the next year. I am surprised to know that the Railways pay dividend to the Government, especially in such a situation when Railway is running in loss and taking loans to meet their capital requirement. It is a traditional system and it is high time that we should come out of it. The Railway is required to undergo tremendous changes. The Railway Zones set up during British era are also required to be changed. The Government is required to make efforts to get the Railways rid of British style of working, if it wants to bail it out of losses. We have demanded to convert Nagpur into a Zone so that administrative mechanism should be run properly.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Railway Convention Committee has been making suggestions on dividends since British era. I have been watching the Rail Budget for the last two years. The Railways is not earning profits and yet the Central Government is not giving any funds for upgradation of the Railways. Today, the infrastructure of the Railways needs to be improved on priority. The funds being given out as dividend should be utilized for redevelopment of the dilapidated railway quarters which are 80-90 years old. Railway station of Hissar was constructed in the year 1959. Why does the Railways not think about redevelopment of this station? People cannot travel to our national capital from Hissar, Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of Haryana. The Government should utilize the dividend funds for introducing a DEMU train and also for construction of ROBs and RUBs.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hon.Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu had stated that this Budget belied the sense of expectation nursed by many segments of population. Major stations should be brought under CCTV surveillance as it will ensure the safety and security. It is heartening to see that the Government will partner with Tamil Nadu for developing suburban systems in Chennai by innovative financing mechanism. I wish to lay emphasis on the demand of the people from Tiruppur Parliamentary constituency for a new railway line from Mettupalayam to Chennai via Sathyamangalam, Gopichettipalayam, Erode. I request the hon.Minister to implement this railway project at the earliest. I also wish the Railway Minister to introduce shuttle service between Tiruppur and Palakkad as well as Tiruppur to Riruchirapalli via Kurur so that people from all walks of life get the benefit of Rail services.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When this Government assumed powers two years back, it had made a tall promise of bringing good times but within 10-15 days railway fares were increased by 14 per cent. The Government had not only increased the passenger fares but it had also affected a major hike in the freight also. But, the passengers are not getting even the basic amenities even after such a unprecedented increase in the fares and freight. It is our humble request that the Government should introduce the bullet train but the infrastructure of the rail system has not been improved to the extent it should have been done. I hail from Marathwada and it is a single rail line there. The Railways should think to lay an additional rail line there. This demand does not belong to my Parliamentary Constituency alone but it will cover at least 10-15 Parliamentary Constituencies. We all 48 Members of Parliament from Maharashtra demanded that the office of Nanded which attached to Sikandrabad should be brought to Mumbai and it will not entail any expenditure. I would, therefore, urge the Government to implement all the promises made by it in the last two years. SHRI DHARMENDRA YADAV: The Ministry of Finance is demanding dividend from the Railways. It appears that the Ministry of Railways has become free of all problems. The basic infrastructure of the Railways has not been upgraded. No ordinary passenger can enter the general category coach even today. The Ministry of Railways is still paying dividend to the Ministry of Finance. Hon.Minister of Railways did a good thing in the Rail Budget that no new project was announced. But, the earlier projects were announced by the then Governments in this House itself with all the responsibility. The projects initiated in the year 1996 in Uttar Pradesh have not yet been completed. Etawa-Mainpuri and Etawa-Agra rail lines have not yet been completed. There are several problems relating to the Railways before the country. We would like the hon.Minister of Railways to first solve all those problems and if still he has got the surplus funds then the bullet train and the high speed train can be introduced, upgradation of the infrastructure can also be done and still the dividend could be paid.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The robust rail system is symbol of the progress of any country. The Railways carries the people to their destinations and also undertakes the important job of transporting the goods from one place to other. Therefore, it is necessary that the basic infrastructure of the Railways should be robust and it should have enough funds for expansion as well. I, on the behalf of all the women of the country, express my sincere gratitude to the hon.Minister of Railways and hon.Prime Minister for providing reservation quota for women. Besides, several new infrastructural facilities have also been provided. By the year 2020, all passengers will get confirmed tickets. The expansion of the Railways not only fulfils the commercial responsibilities but it is related to the social aspirations of the people also. I would like to bring into the kind notice of the hon.Minister of Railways that a short distance train plies in my Constituency and its timetable is wrong. I would, therefore, like to request that its timetable should be changed suitably and this train should ply all seven days.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Resolution brought about by the hon.Minister of Railways raises many questions. Railways is the lifeline of the country. DRM Office has been sanctioned for Bhagalpur but is yet to come up. New intercity in Banka is yet to see the light of the day. There is no progress regarding modernization of Jamalpur Rail Karkhana. Rajdhani should run daily from Jasi Dih. Rajdhani should also run via Bhagalpur. So, should a Jan Shatabdi. Work should begin on the new rail line from Sultanganj to Asarganj via Belhar. Track should be doubled from Kiul to Kadra. Railway which is our lifeline should see improved security, safety, catering and other passenger amenities. All rail projects in Bihar have come to a standstill.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railway, in reality is the lifeline of the country making important contribution in the social, economic and cultural development as well as important from strategic point of view also. Railway was misused during the past 25-30 years. Only assurances were given. During the first NDA regime, the idea was mooted for the dedicated freight corridor. When the UPA came, work either came to standstill or very little was done. Unless the dedicated freight corridor is ready, problems of Railways cannot be solved. A lot needs to be done from the strategic point of view in North-East and Kashmir.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Hon.Minister of Railways is the first Minister who instead of making announcements is going all out to complete the incomplete works. Today, there is cleanliness in railway stations as well as all trains. The hon.Minister of Railways took the initiative to make available warm water and warm milk to the new borns to their berths. This may appear a minor thing but is very commendable. The progress in Uttar Pradesh regarding Railways now is more than all the progress made since independence. Electrification work was completed from Kanpur to Kasganj and from Farrukhabad to Shikohabad. Four flyovers were also sanctioned. A train should be introduced for Hazrat Nizamuddin from Kanpur to Kannauj touching Farrukhabad, Manpuri and Agra. A direct train should be introduced from Farrukhabad to Delhi. A new rail line should be laid from Aligarh to Kasganj-a distance of only 52 Kms.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I congratulate the hon.Minister of Railways for taking up the pending projects. I request the hon.Minister of Railways that railway tickets should be allowed to be returned at least one hour after the train departs. I request the hon.Minister for doubling of Bakhtiyarpur- Rajgir railway line. DMU should be introduced via Daniyama-Patna. All halts have been constructed between Phatua to Bihar Shareef but without sheds and no drinking water arrangements. Pending Islampur-Natesar rail section should be completed. Efforts should be made to run more duronto trains from Patna to Delhi. Saharsa Garib Rath, and Poorva Express be extended to Saharsa. Amritsar-Katihar Express be extended to Purnea.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We all know that 8.39 Billion passengers traveled by Indian Railways in 2014-15. The freight carried was 1058 Million tonnes. I too certainly support the recommendations of the Committee that the Railways should arrange its own resources and become self-sufficient. The Railways progressed immensely, be it Jammu-Kashmir or North-East. The progress made by Railways in various fields is certainly creditworthy. Railways today is making all-round progress. Madhya Pradesh lags far-far behind other States regarding railway lines. We should adopt the PPP mode for progress and development of Railways.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

North-East happens to be an area which has been largely neglected by the Ministry of Railways in this current Government. I am thankful to the previous Government and former Prime Minister, who gave national project status to important projects in the North-East such as Bogibeel bridge and Silchar-Lamding broad gauge conversion. The Ministry of Railways sent a proposal to the Ministry of Finance so that we get more funds. But unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance has come back with a negative reply. No new national projects have been given to the North-East by the current Government. The 25th Report of the Standing Committee specifies that the projects in North-East should be given top priority and should be given support. So, I would request the hon.Minister to set up NERRD Fund. There should be new national projects for North-East, especially in my constituency, Lok Kaliabor.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First of all, I congratulate the hon.Minister of Railways for his continuous efforts. Will the Minister make arrangements to provide free travel or tickets on concession rates to the BPL student going to take their exams. Similarly, will the patients with incurable disease going for treatment be allowed to travel free? Will the workers from the unorganized sector all over the country especially from Kosi and Tirhut be allowed to travel on concession tickets going out in search of employment? Will two or three coaches be attached in all trains for women passengers? Will the Minister make efforts to link the major tourist spots and pilgrimage centres in Bihar – the sole source of income left with Bihar? Amritsar-Katihar Train be run via Saharsa. All trains running from Katihar should go via Saharsa. All trains originating from Barauni should be extended to Saharsa. Train should be introduced via Bhagalpur from Saharsa to Kolkata and from Saharsa to Ranchi via Munger. Some of the rail lines such as Anugrah Narayan Road to Surya Mandir, Madhubani to place of birth place of world famous Mathili Poet, Vidyapati Ji, Ahilya Sthaan, Saharsa to Kusesar, Bihariganj via Kishenganj to Simri-Bakhtiyarpur, Sitamarhi to Shivhar be completed. I request upgradation of some stations such as Saharsa, Madhepura and Supaul. Saharsa should be made a zone. SHRI K. PARASURAMAN: This year, Railway Budget belied the sense of expectation with no new trains no new railways lines and no specific projects were announced. Dedicated Freight Corridor from Delhi to Chennai should have been rightly extended upto Thoothukudi. A new railway line from Thanjavur to Ariyalur, be constructed at the earliest. Thanjavur to Thiruchirapalli doubling work is progressing very slowly. This has to be expedited. Thanjavur Railway Junction needs to be upgraded and modernized with all the required facilities.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Coach Factory in Warangal should be set up. Upgradation of Mahabubnagar Railway Station should be undertaken. Doubling of the track from Secunderabad to Mahabubnagar be completed. Special coach for the elderly people should be given in trains. The fares in Maharaja Express for the domestic passengers should be fixed in Indian rupees and it should not be linked with dollar.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railway is the life line of India. There is a great expectation from this organization and it requires a lot of money to meet those expectations. The demand of laying Parasnath-Giridih railway line under the Giridih Lok Sabha constituency has been pending since 1996. The work of laying this railway line should be completed and work of Giridih-Kuwad railway line should also be completed at the earliest.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railways is our national treasure and important life line for the country. However, railways has been in deep trouble for a long time. All of us have to make an effort to pull it out because that is where our interest lies. There are issues which are coming out of the Resolution itself. Issue related to how much financial support - considering the importance of the Railways - Central Government, by way of General Budget, would give it to Railways. The convention of railway paying dividend to the Government is a British legacy. Now, the Railways are in a completely different situation. At that time, Railways were not taking 'public service' obligation. Now, we are taking it. Therefore, we really need to relook at the issue completely. Railways are bearing the 'public service' obligation to the tune of Rs.34,000 crore. Each country, including the most developed countries in the world support the Railways through their budgets. The issue comes in because subsidy is there, Gross Budgetary Support is given. Normally, the Gross Budgetary Support goes into various issues. Part of the issue is national projects, which are so important for the country. When we run these nationally important projects, we obviously need Gross Budgetary Support. Also, when we run these lines, they are not profitable but they are run for some strategic purposes. Therefore, there is also a need to have operational subsidy. The inherent reasons for giving subsidy lies in the fact that these are the lines which have been created only for strategic purposes. So, when we get the GBS, to provide dividend on it is something, which is overburdening the organization. Therefore, I am saying that the Gross Budgetary Support on which the dividend is given, needs some proper re-look. Railways require a huge investment. Investment would mean that we need to get money from somewhere. So, from the main Budget, if we get the money on which we have to pay the dividend, it would cause an additional burden. So, we need to find out monies, which would come from alternative sources. Therefore, we need to get more revenues in the railways. One traditional revenue is the freight traffic. We have been losing it to the road sector all the time. We have taken many new initiatives which are reforming the freight sector of the railways in a significant way. We are also working on passengers side in a significant way. To get the passengers back to the railways, we have taken up a number of measures. Apart from it, we have been taking several measures to increase the non-revenue income of railways which do not come from the traditional sources of revenue. We have been trying to take several measures to reduce the cost. We have also started a new complaint redressal mechanism. We are restructuring various arms of Railways organisation in a significant way. We have already taken a number of measures. We are also delegating powers to bring in more decentralisation. Many hon.Members have pointed out that they need something significantly more for their States than what was available. As I explained, we have increased that amount from Rs.40,000 crore to Rs.1,21,000 crore, which is almost three times. People of Kerala can think a lot about national issue. We are working on PPP, we are also doing international collaboration. We are also involving citizens for making Railways viable. We are preparing an on the ground plan for 2030 about how railway connectivity should happen. We have already started the work. We are making three new dedicated freight corridors. We are preparing a national policy for the Railways. The previous Government had appointed Mr. Rakesh Mohan to come out with an integrated transport policy. We need an integrated transport policy of which the Railways will be an component. But, the idea is, the involvement of all of you. Everybody wants more. But, more is not enough. To make it from more to enough, the Railways must become vibrant. To make that, we need strategy which we have put in place and with such a great support that I received from you all, it is going to happen for sure. With this, I put this resolution for passing by this august House. The Resolution was adopted.
