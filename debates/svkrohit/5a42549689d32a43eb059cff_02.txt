 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill.
