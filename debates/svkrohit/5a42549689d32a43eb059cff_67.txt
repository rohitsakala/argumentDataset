We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++It is a very straightforward and simple bill. Hon.Prime Minister had a dream of 'one nation, one tax'. There were many efforts in this direction. Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of all States were called. All were made aware of the importance of GST. When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir, we can understand why it was not implemented there at the same time. It was not possible because of Article 370 of the Constitution. BJP is a partner in Jammu and Kashmir Government. Why is there delay even then? We spend lakhs and crores of rupees from the consolidated fund of India in protecting Jammu and Kashmir. We provide special package. We faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. In reality, we were victorious but a part of Kashmir is still occupied by Pakistan. Pak-occupied Kashmir means our land occupied by Pakistan and terrorist camps have come up there. Terrorism is affecting us for years. We are proud of the surgical strike by our forces. We were shown the video in the Home Ministry in which our Jawans crossed the border and destroyed more than 40 terrorist camps within 12 hours. On the other hand, there is China. This is a majority government hence, Article 370 of the Constitution should be abolished. It is important to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir as well, so we are supporting this Bill.
