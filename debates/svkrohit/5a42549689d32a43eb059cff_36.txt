 We disapprove of this Bill as our problem is with the way in which this Government has implemented it. Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed the GST when the Opposition was not present in the Assembly. The Opposition claimed that this was a violation of Jammu & Kashmir Constitution and of Article 370 because it eroded the State's special status in terms of its own financial autonomy and its legislative powers which are reserved for the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. By impinging upon the power of the State to impose taxes, the Government is violating the fundamental power of that Government. By extending GST to Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre gains effective control of the taxation in the State. That was, of course, something which was reserved by the Constitution for the State Government. The State has been dealing with conflict for a long time and we must absolutely not do anything that might harm its stability. GST tax rates are far more complicated than it needs to be. This is the Minister who told us that he was opposed to tax terrorism, instead what we are seeing is tax form terrorism. We are seeing something which obviously is going to cause a whole amount of problems, increasing works for everybody involved in business. There is a particular problem when it relates to Jammu and Kashmir. Its principle revenue generation is tourism which has been affected by terrorism. The 28 per cent GST now is going to affect all of the tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. If this is not rolled back, it is likely to make Kashmir uncompetitive in tourism. My State, Kerala has become uncompetitive in tourism because the tax rate is driving up the cost beyond any of our neighbouring States. GST has been applied at the rate of 12 per cent on highway construction which is going to come to a halt. I do want to stress finally that there is also a great threat of litigation coming up about which tax brackets, which companies fall into and how their goods should be categorised. The Government has raised the cost of many goods for GST. The current Government version of GST, I am sorry, would have a negative effect on GDP instead of a positive one and it would actually fulfil the warning of the National Institute of Public Policy. The Parliament today must contemplate the impact of GST on the Centre's relation with J&K before we make the major mistake of passing this Bill without adequate consultation with the stakeholders.

We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?
