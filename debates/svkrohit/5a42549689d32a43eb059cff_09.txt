 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

GST has united the fragmented tax structure and created one tax throughout the nation and now it is being extended to Jammu and Kashmir. Now with this Bill, it is truly one tax for the entire nation. With GST, India is now the single largest market in the world, not the USA or China. This Bill has been brought to replace the ordinance issued by the President on 8th July 2017 and it will extend the scope of GST to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Agriculture items are removed from the purview of GST. This is very welcome. But, there are some commodities like chillies, turmeric and red gram which are of agriculture, but the GST Council is not considering them as agriculture commodities. I request the Finance Minister to look into these and remove GST on chillies, turmeric and other non-processed and naturally processed agriculture commodities including tobacco. The proposed five per cent GST on man-made yarn, fabric and readymade garments should be removed. Input credit should not be restricted to 12 months for the builders and credit should be given for all the invoices the stocks of which were held in stock on the appointed day. GST on sanitary napkins and branded vegetables should not be there. I am surprised to see that hybrid and electric cars are being taxed even higher than petrol and diesel cars. It needs a relook. As many Members have already stated, I too feel that there are still too many rates. I would like you to consider maximum of three slabs instead of six and remove multiple slabs for same goods and services. There is still a need to bring about customer awareness on GST. Malaysia had enacted an Anti- Profiteering legislation at the time of their introduction of GST. I think that would be something that we should consider as well. At the time of bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh was promised that we would be given industrial incentives in line with Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh but now it is told to us that because of GST that is no longer going to be the case because excise duty exemption is no longer going to be possible. But now, the States are getting GST refund in lieu of those incentives. I would also like to demand, to keep up with the promises made to us and whatever is being given to hilly States like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh the same benefits should be extended to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
