 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself.

We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?
