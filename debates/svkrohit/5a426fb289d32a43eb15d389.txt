The incidents of atrocities and mob lynching in this country are deplorable. Whether the persons losing their lives in such incidents belong to Hindu, Muslims, Sikh or Christian community. Today, the specter of fear and terror is looming large over the entire country. These incidents have tarnished the image of India across the world and the recurrence of the incidents of mob lynching and murder is not coming to a halt. Law and order is going from bad to worse. These incidents have shaken the conscience of the patriots and the humanist people of this country. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees right to life to every citizen. Communal and criminal incidents continue to take place since the NDA Government came to power in the country. The perpetrators of such incidents are directly or indirectly being encouraged from the Government side. Seventy years have passed since we got Independence but during these seventy years such incidents have never taken place in the name of religion, cow and cow vigilantism. Our country has always been known for spreading fraternity. But today, we have forgotten the message given by Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Guru Nanak, Bashweshwar and Narayan Guru. The minorities, the downtrodden and women are being murdered defying the law. Such incidents are taking place in all the BJP-ruled states namely Gujarat, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. What steps the Government is taking or going to take to check the recurrence of such incidents? On the one hand it is said that action will be taken against the perpetrators of mob lynching and they will be liable to get stringent punishment but on the other hand no action has so far been taken against such persons. This is why, incidents of mob lynching are ever increasing in Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. No one is held above the Constitution in our country. I, therefore, would like to say that no one should take the law in his hand. If anybody takes law in his hand, he should be taught a lesson. The Government is forcefully imposing its ideology and hence it needs to be opposed. Today, such people are at the helm of affairs that are causing trouble to all the people and at the same time usurping their rights.

Today, crores of Indian people must be watching this discussion on their television sets. I would like to make an appeal to those viewers to watch this discussion, think about the issue and then take a decision. As far as incidents of mob lynching are concerned, I would like to say that some people in disguise are behind these terrorist activities in a planned manner to tarnish and malign the image of the Government. There was an incident in Kashmir wherein a DSP rank police officer was lynched by a mob while he was attending a function. Was it not a case of mob lynching? On the one hand our defence forces are fighting for security of our borders and fighting against the terrorists, on the other hand people gathering in a crowd indulge in stone pelt on our defence forces and obstructing them from discharging their patriotic duties. It was said that a person was killed in the train. But it was reported that this whole matter had started with a quarrel over train seats. Don't give this incident a communal colour. Sangh Pracharaks visit Kerala to propagate their ideology but they are killed there. Is it not an incident of mob lynching? Is the person killed in this particular incident not a human being? A prominent leader of a political party in Jharkhand appealed that the naxalites should vote for a particular party and support it. Does it not promote mob lynching? There is a village called Bispi, Lohra Subol in my constituency. People of that village wanted to take out a religious procession on a public road of the area. But people of another village called Narsam who belong to a particular community said that they would not allow the religious procession to go through on that road, because there was a religious place of that particular community along that road. Is preventing cultural procession and obstructing the religious rituals of any community lesser crime than mob lynching? There are some people in the country who lack the courage to oppose this Government directly, so they are fighting a proxy war. I request the crores of educated young people of this country that they should understand the things in totality. Sikhs were massacred in Delhi, was it not mob lynching? Should we consider only a select few incidents as incidents of mob lynching? About 2200 Yadav youth belonging to the backward caste and who were opposing Congress in Uttar Pradesh, were killed in encounter. What kind of lynching was that, it was state lynching? I would like to submit to the crores of poor people, farmers, labourers, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians of the country that they have been made to fight with one another and they have been subjected to massacre as well. So, all of us should fight against it.

I shall be dealing with mob violence relating to bovine issue, that is, cow related mob violence. This is not a BJP Vs Opposition or Hindu Vs Muslim debate. One magazine prepared a database from 2010 to 2017 to show as to how many bovine issues related incidents took place in all. They calculated that from 2010 to 2017, there were 63 incidents. I do not want to bring in Hindus and Muslims here. But 97 per cent of these incidents between 2010 and 2017 took place after Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Of the 28 people who were killed in these bovine issue related incidents, 86 per cent were Muslims. I want to say that these cow related killings are all targeted killings. I want to mention that very few cases of bovine-related violence happened in Eastern States including Bengal and Odisha. It is not being controlled because the ruling party's top leaders were very shy of condemning these incidents. The Prime Minister himself has so far made only two statements condemning gau rakshak. It is a good thing to give a statement. But, why did it take him so long? The question is not: "In whose time it was carried out?" The question is: "whether the Governments are performing their duties? I am making some concrete suggestions. Under Cr.PC and IPC, lynching is not defined. Under Section 223(a) of Cr.PC you can say that in mob killing, people should be judged differently. I demand a separate law. I suggest that a Manav Suraksha Kanoon, for preventing lynching, should be brought by the Government. I do not know who will be in power but people in whose time human beings are beaten to death will not be pardoned in the annals of history. THE MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC

There was a time when corruption was a major issue in our country, but today opposition does not have any issue to speak on corruption. They are compromising with the corrupt people. They do not have any issue pertaining to corruption against us. They do not have any issue with regard to development as well. The social issues are over and but the only issue which has remained with them is the issue of gau rakshaks. I would like to submit that these two things cannot go together. On one hand, they talk about federal structure and on the other they thrust the state subjects on the centre. I would have been happy if something had been said as to what the state governments are required to do. The Prime Minister has not only once, but twice said that some anti-social elements have incited violence in the name of cow protection. Those engaged in disturbing the harmony in the country are trying to take advantage of the situation. It has an impact on the image of the nation. State Governments must sternly deal with such anti-social elements. He further said that maintaining law and order is the responsibility of State Governments and wherever these incidents are taking place, State Governments must deal with it firmly. The Prime Minister makes such an appeal not once but twice, still politics is played over here. What do they want? Do they want that Army be sent to such places where such rowdyism takes place? Today the House should unanimously pass a resolution against such kind of incidents. Secondly, all the political parties with one voice should appeal to the Chief Minister of all the States that a prompt action should be taken against those involved in such incidents within 24 hours and they should be sent behind the bars and cases of murder should be initiated against them.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Government at Centre and in some States are under attack over lynch mobs killing those suspected of cow slaughter or eating beef, and leaders from both ruling and opposition parties have termed such incidents as serious. There have been more lynching incidents in 2011, 2012 and 2013. There has been an increase in the number incidents of lynching every year in the past. Vigilante cow protection groups have killed people for transporting cattle. Women are routinely branded as witches and lynched to death for property in large parts of the country. All these things need to be addressed seriously. People belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes face persistent discrimination and serious crimes are committed against them. In the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, a group of dalits have been flogged in public who were allegedly skinning a dead cow in Mota Samadhiyala a village near Una town. Empower the women to empower the nation. Atrocities against women belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe should be tried by Special Courts for women with women judges and women public prosecutors, preferably, belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe Community. All-Women Police Stations in Tamil Nadu -- first of its kind in the world provide assistance and redress the grievances of all women, especially, the SCs and STs. The concern for protecting the rights and dignity of people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes has been a major challenge even after 70 years of India's Independence. The Tamil Nadu Government has taken several steps by framing appropriate policies needed to design and implement various welfare programmes for achieving the objectives of creating favourable environment to ensure speedy socio-economic development of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Despite special protective laws and their implementation for many decades, the Scheduled Castes continue to be the victims of caste-based untouchability and atrocities. The law enforcement agency, the police and the judiciary, should be free from caste prejudice to address this perennial social problem. We should be united and committed to protect the basic human rights and principles of justice, equality, liberty, fraternity.

Lynching is a very serious thing. Every single individual Indian is precious for all of us sitting in this House. What is the crux of the problem? Who sells the cows and bullocks? It is the poor Hindu farmer. As long as a cow is milching and a bullock can till, no farmer wants to give up that animal. It is only when the animal gets older and is incapable of working that the poor Hindu farmer is compelled to sell the animals. Who buys it? It is an economic circle. It could be another Hindu or Muslim. Sometimes, it comes to Uttar Pradesh where it is killed, sometimes, it goes to Bangladesh and sometimes, it is done even in certain States within India. Now, I notice that these buyers have actually stopped going to our villages. They are scared. So, what is happening? Our farmers are unable to sell the useless animals. The economic cycle has been put to a stop. This would have been their cede money to get another loan. They are unable to get a loan to get another pair of bullocks. So, it has actually damaged the rural economy. By this lynching process, a movement has started which will eventually kill the farmer. If a farmer keeps a animal which is useless, that animal eats dana (feed) of minimum Rs.100 a day. Apart from that, farmers have to spend anything between Rs.300 and Rs.700 for medication to get the vet to feed him medicines or inject medicines. But let us acknowledge that our love for cow is being misconstrued and twisted to unleash terror on unsuspecting Indians. This is an organized attempt at disruption and distraction from real problems that India faces today. The statistics released by the National Crime Record Bureau in its Annual Report 'Crime in India' reveals that in 2015 the number of agrarian riots has increased. The number of agrarian riots has increased by a massive 327 per cent. These are official numbers. These are little sparks but signs of a towering crisis. Everybody has the right to privacy; everybody has the right to chose what he or she will wear, what he or she will eat, how he or she will live, and what languages they will speak. That is the beauty of this country. You cannot make this country a unified country according to your thought of unification. We are united, we were united, and we shall remain united for India; not for certain people's dreams.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This question arises as to why violence and atrocities are taking place in this country? The main reason for it is the underlying inequality. Therefore, I would like to say that violence is taking place either in the name of religion or in the name of caste. The violence starts at the level of family. There is a need to check the family violence first and foremost. The maximum brunt of atrocities is borne by the dalits. The violence and discrimination are taking place in the name of regionalism, rich and poor and also in the name of language. So much so that even the colour of one's skill becomes the basis of discrimination. Various atrocities and discrimination do take place against women also. All this should be stopped and its beginning should be made at the family level.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today the country has been discussing a very serious subject. It is the religion and the caste, which dominates the agenda of our national discourse. The political parties should not indulge in any discriminatory practice while addressing the grievance of an individual at the receiving end of injustice. I would like to condemn the lynching in the severest possible terms. I have been in the domain of politics and social policy formulation for the last 30-40 years. I have never given any attention towards the eating habits of the people. I have always taken it as a gift of nature. Nobody gives us any right to indulge in atrocity against others on the basis of their eating habit. To carry the point forward I would like to stress that to kill somebody over his eating habits is even a greater crime. Our country stands for unity in diversity and is home to diverse religions and castes. Our Constitution also has recognized these diversities. There is an issue relating to Vande Mataram in Maharashtra because some people say that they would not chant Vande Mataram but this kind of attitude weakens our unity. As far as lynching is concerned, our hon.Prime Minister has condemned it in strongest possible words. Let us see that our country is not divided. Let us make it united as it was.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Mob violence represents a breakdown of law and order. It does not have place in a peaceful, democratic and orderly society. It is clear that mob violence has been increasing continuously, not in the last three to four years but in the last 20 years, etc. But one thing that stands out is that cow related mob violence has grown from five per cent to over 20 per cent by June, 2017. The Prime Minister himself has recognized the problem of this cow related violence and has strongly spoken out against violence, including the cow related vigilantism. Violence is happening across the country. I do not think anyone can attribute it only to the BJP or the non-BJP ruled States. What is clear is that there are certain parties that are pursuing minority vote bank politics or majority polarisation politics, region based politics, caste based politics or any type of politics that would divide society basically. I think all the political parties have to look at themselves and understand how they are dividing the society and not unifying the society. I believe that the President, the Prime Minister, the Chief Ministers and leaders of all political parties need to rise above this type of politics and condemn mob related violence.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to confine myself to the issue. Hon.Minister has given a very concrete suggestion that there should be a censure motion against the incidents of mob lynching. There should also be an amendment in the IPC for the enactment of a new law to include mob lynching and the State Governments should be directed to ensure the arrest of criminal within 24 hours after the crime and punishment should be meted out at the earliest possible. The Government should agree to the suggestion of its own minister. We support it. Citizens are killings fellow citizens. The whole country is watching as to how much sensitive we are to those who are being killed. We ought to be sensitive to those who are on the receiving end. When somebody is killed or lynched by the mob and still somebody justifies it then it cannot be taken as an issue of law and order. We need to keep our views right. If somebody is killing someone then why should he do it under some name? Such people are killers only. Our government, the leaders of opposition parties, the journalists and all should say that they are killers. The cover or the philosophy which is resorted to or which promote it is wrong and it is not a merely an issue of law and order. Hon.Prime Minister has condemned it but merely condemnation will not serve any purpose. There has to be concerted efforts to ensure that peace prevails.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What is happening in the country is really unfortunate. We from Telangana are totally confused. We come from a culture of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. From our 17 MPs, the mother tongues of five MPs are totally different. No other State in India has MPs with five different mother tongues. We are the true India. We are the youngest State, but in terms of tolerance, we are the number one State. I think, this is an example for India to follow.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

India is a truly democratic country with secularism and tolerance as its backbone. People are trying to take law into their hands and impose punishments which are sometimes leading to killings. But, unfortunately, in the first six months of 2017, 20 cow terror attacks were reported - more than 75 per cent of the 2016 figure - which was the worst year for such violence since 2010. It is happening for the past ten years and it is increasing rapidly. These attacks include mob lynching. We have witnessed a very big incident in Garagaparru in Andhra Pradesh. A huge mob of dalits were attacked for erecting a Ambedkar statue in that village. They are deprived of all the facilities and they are not being allowed to enter the temples of worship as well as even for the basic amenities. So, they are demanding different gram panchayats for the Dalits so that they will also develop leadership qualities among themselves. It is the responsibility on all of us to combindely rise to the occasion. Without any blame game.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I think whole-heartedly this whole House needs to condemn every lynching that happened in this country. The whole point is that lynching is a very sensitive issue. We in one voice need to send a message to this country that does not matter which caste, creed, city, State or party we come from. We as one Parliament condemn it and that is the message this country is looking for in modern India. That man in Nagpur was hit and nobody condemned it. I must congratulate the Rajasthan Chief Minister. She had the courage to write an article against mob lynching. I also compliment the Chief Minister of Jharkhand who sacked the SP there. But Maharashtra has not taken any action. We are proud of our Indian culture and ahimsa is at the centre of our culture. We all have to find out way to ensure that if somebody is caught in mob lynching, should not get bail. A poor radio jockey of Mumbai made a simple song against the potholes of Mumbai. The Maharashtra Government has given her a notice. Is this really the freedom we are looking on? People eat beef to get protein. Let the Government give dal to the entire country. I am sure they will be happy to change their diet. Every man is born free and we should not impose our likings or dislikings on anyone.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today we are discussing about the mob lynching in the country and the reported incidents of atrocities. There were 1194 incidents of communal violence from 1950 to 1995 in the entire country out of which 72 per cent incidents had taken place during a particular party's regime. In these incidents, 7052 people had been killed. They were all mob lynching only. As far as Karnataka is concerned, during the last four years, a total of 12 people have been killed. The Chief Minister of Karnataka recently visited Mangalore after a broad daylight murder. The Chief Minister did not have courage to condemn the incident openly. He also said, 'people who are working for the Hindu organizations, Ham unki bali chadha denge'. Is it an offence to work for a Hindu organizations? A 32 year old young man, on February 19, 2015 was hacked to death by a group of Popular Front of India activists. All the ten people, who have been murdered there during the tenure of the present Government, are either OBC or SC. RSS and BJP functionaries and have been killed and even a single arrest has not been made. In Kerala, a total of 17 people have been killed in the present situation. In West Bengal, there was attack on BJP MP. BJP office was attacked. Communist regimes across the world killed 100 million people. From 1977 to 1996, a total of 28,000 political murders had taken place in West Bengal. The BJP treats all as Indians. Secularism is in the blood of the people.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today this House is having discussion on a very important issue. This country belongs to all be they Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Christians but the atmosphere in the country is being vitiated. It is inhuman if someone fails to differentiate between humans and animals. I am born in a Yadav family and cow rearing is our traditional profession. We are those who take all religions along.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our Prime Minister has been claiming repeatedly that he is the Prime Minister of 125 crore of Indians. So he can feel the pain and happiness of all Indians. But his deeds do not match with words. Today Dalits, Muslims, Tribals and Weaker Sections are facing atrocities across the country. The enemies of our society are emboldened everywhere. They feel that they can kill any one they want and nobody can harm them. They are openly insulting the constitution and constitutional bodies. They are destroying the democratic fabric. Modi Government is only an onlooker and seems to be helpless. The responsibility of Prime Minister does not rest in giving statement but also for taking action against the guilty. The action taken by the Government against the people involved in beating and killing of people in the name of cow protection, reveals that Government is calling it just a law and order problem while the fact is that it is the matter and result of extremist mentality. Our country should not be defamed. Our diverse culture should be saved. I have full faith in the secularism and democracy and people of India have faith in the constitutional values of India. They are worried about the direction in which the country of Gandhi is going. They are worried that this was the dream of freedom fighters. All the right thinking and justice loving people are worried. Undoubtedly the conscience of the country is still alive.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In fact, wherever the killings have taken place whether in Kerala, Karnataka, Darjeeling it is humanity that has been killed. Why are only the members of minority, dalits, the weaker sections killed by the violent mob? The politicization of police in this regard plays a major role. In Punjab, in Bahwalkalan a crowd was peacefully performing kirtan against the desecration of Shri Guru Granth Sahib. The police fired upon them and in the FIR mentioned unidentified police personnel. The mob is instigated by the instigating speeches of the leaders.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am fully confident that none of these brothers are involved in mob lynching. Nor do they ever want incidents of mob lynching to take place. It is regrettable that a turn has been given to the debate as if they are responsible for mob lynching. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that this is a state issue. He has asked the states to take a stringent action. It is the responsibility of the States to give justice. My view is that in such a sensitive issue accusation and counter accusation is not good. This does not give the right message to the nation. Being people's representatives, we should give the right message. SHRI P.K. KUNHALIKUTTY: It is a sad thing that we have to talk about mob lynching in this century when we should have been discussing on development, Digital India etc. This whole discussion is about the fundamental principles and secularism that we should uphold. Murders are taking place in many states of the country. The minorities, the dalits are being targeted. But such a thing was not as widespread or as usual as it is now. Mob lynching has become a real social problem now. What will the tourist, especially the foreign tourists say about our country? It is not the way we take the country to the 21st century. The skinning of dead animals is the profession traditionally carried on. But one morning, you come out with a law notifying that such a thing should not be done from tomorrow onwards. In my opinion, these Thuglaq-like reforms are not at all correct. We had the demonetization; and again this notification. It will affect the industry; agriculture, exports, meat trade, jobs and everything will be affected in that way. This notification will also affect us seriously.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Who was responsible for the partition of Bharat and lynching of millions, everyone knows. Mob lynching is even now taking place in my own home State Kerala. Day before yesterday in Kerala there was an attempt on the life of the BJP State President and a Swayam Sewak was brutally lynched in Thiruvananthapuram. Hon.Members are only speaking about cow vigilantism. Why not they apply their minds on sporadic violence and lynching occurring continuously in Kerala? Lynching people in the name of Party and politics has to be condemned. In the name of ideology hatred is unleashed in Kerala. Democracy is in peril. In 17 month 17 people were killed. In toto, 275 Swayam Sewaks were lynched in the last few decades in Kerala. It is a frightening situation for women, dalits and the weak. In Kerala, I have seen cows slaughtered in the most unhygienic conditions and in the most cruel methods. Cow slaughter banning, in nearly half of the states is roughly 50 years old. In 24 States and Union Territories that prohibit cow slaughter, the offence is cognizable and in more than half of them it is non-bailable.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I want to emphasize that incidents of mob lynching will not end because this Government is promoting religion as ideology, which is against the Constitution. Mob lynching will not end as long as BJP promotes cultural nationalism and dalits and Muslims would continue to be killed. The day the BJP adopts Constitutional nationalism mob lynching will end. The third thing is that the Government has utterly failed in its constitutional duty. Muslims and dalits are victims of targeted killings. A decision should be taken that cow protection is an essential part of Hindu religion. If the Government is unable to do it on its own then it should be referred to Supreme Court. I would appeal to my Hindu brothers to save themselves from Hindutva. Our fight is not against Hinduism, it is against Hindutva. This country needs to be saved from it. The Government is promoting Hindutva. THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to put forth the views of the government on today's notice on" Reported incidents of atrocities and lynching in mob violence in the country" tabled by Hon.Kharge Ji and Saugat Rai ji. We are committed to the Constitution and all of us whether Prime minster, or Minister or MPs all have taken oath to stick to the provisions of the Constitution and the country runs as per the constitutional provisions. Article 246, Entry 15 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule and Section 39 of the CRPC clearly mention the preservation, protection and improvement of cow and milch animals. Based on the provisions of law, we have issued clear advisory to all States and Union Territories of the country that mob lynching or anything related to that will not be acceptable. The Union Government can't take over state administration just because there is one incident. The Central Government is working under the provisions of the constitution. I was apprehensive since the beginning that they have no interest in the discussion and the issue is being raised with political motives. The Prime Minister has condemned the incidents very clearly and asked the state government to act sternly on such incidents. The opposition has practiced the politics of vote bank in the name of atrocities on Dalits or Muslims. I have the figures of my government as well as of earlier government. As per the record of 2016, the incidents of atrocities on Dalits were highest in UP followed by Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. We came in power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. There is trend in the country which does not change with the change in Government. As far as communal violence is concerned, Kerala reported the highest cases of communal violence in 2014. All the cases filed under section 153, 153A and 153 B were highest in Kerala. Likewise in 2015 highest number of communal clashes were reported in UP, followed by Telangana and Karnataka. Again in 2016, Uttar Pradesh was followed by West Bengal. These are the official figures submitted by the respective State Governments. The Centre does not report such incidents. Instead of giving suggestion as to how the States and the Centre should come together to work effectively, you are engaged in unprolific act of targeting the Prime Minister and the Central Government. What do you expect to reap by such move? There is no dichotomy in State and Central Government's machineries. They have better coordination. Our Government acts on such incidents very swiftly. Till date, 24 States and 5 Union Territories have framed their own laws on banning or restricting the slaughter of animals and their progenies while 05 states and One Union Territory have no legislation in this regard. All the States do not have same legal provisions. These provisions differ from State to State. These States are free to act as per their respective laws. The Central Government cannot interfere with it. The present debate has two main issues, one is mob lynching and the other is atrocities. Mob lynching is a worst form of crime which should be condemned universally. People are suffering from Selective amnesia nowadays in which selective issues are raised. Some time ago, issue of 'intolerance' was raked up, and then it was 'Award-Wapsi', then 'freedom of expression' and later on 'attacks on Churches'. Now the issue of 'mob lynching' is being raised. Such issues were raised which did not even happen. It was accused that if BJP came in power in Arunachal Pradesh, all would be converted to Hindus and the Christians are being prosecuted. I will tender my resignation, if any single prosecution of my Christian brethren is proved since the BJP came to power. There are many States and UTs in our country which have a population of 1.3 billion people and many unfortunate incidents do take place. All of us condemn such incidents. There should be no party politics. Whenever Prime Minister makes an appeal, we should take it seriously. The more opposition tries to defame us, the more they will get defamed themselves and BJP will be stronger. The discussion was concluded.
