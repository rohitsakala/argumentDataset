 that this House disapproves of the Central Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir), Ordinance, 2017 (Ordinance No. 3 of 2017) promulgated by the President on 8th July, 2017. And Also moved that this House disapproves of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir), Ordinance 2017 (Ordinance No. 4 of 2017) promulgated by the President on 8th July, 2017. THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, MINISTER OF CORPORATE 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 the motion for consideration of the Bills, said: The Goods and Services Tax was introduced by a legislative process by which we first amended the Constitution of India. But then because of the provisions of Article 370, the Constitution Amendment was applicable to the whole country except to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, Jammu & Kashmir, under their Constitution, had to separately undergo a legislative process. Jammu & Kashmir went through that legislative process and finally passed a Resolution in their State Assembly and then brought in a relevant legislation by virtue of which they passed their own State GST Act. However, corresponding changes had to be made in the Central GST Act and the Integrated GST Act. Wherever we have mentioned inapplicability to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, that is being deleted because now the CGST Act will also apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Similarly, in the IGST Act, similar corresponding changes have been made which are necessary upon the integration of the State GST into the Central GST so that they can become a part of the IGST chain itself. These are formal amendments which are required to the CGST Act and SGST Act recognizing the fact that the State of Jammu & Kashmir is integrated and therefore, in pursuant to that integration, the exemption that we have carved out for the State is intended to be taken away. It is a very fortunate development because it brings about the economic integration of the whole country. It is in larger interest because of one reason, if they did not integrate with the national GST, then for goods sold in the State which are manufactured outside the State, they would not get the benefit of input credit. That would mean that at the interim stage, some taxes have been paid on which they would not get credit and on the final product they will be paying their entire tax for a second time. Inherently, that would have made every product in the State of Jammu & Kashmir costlier. The consumers would have had to pay more. Similarly, the traders would have felt that their trade will shrink because people would have preferred to buy outside the State rather than within the State because the products outside the State would have become cheaper itself. The State itself benefits because this will also impact on the revenue of the State itself. Therefore, in every sense, the people, the Government, the Assembly needs to be complemented for having taken this decision for having integrated, in the larger interest of its people, the GST into the national process itself. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We disapprove of this Bill as our problem is with the way in which this Government has implemented it. Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed the GST when the Opposition was not present in the Assembly. The Opposition claimed that this was a violation of Jammu & Kashmir Constitution and of Article 370 because it eroded the State's special status in terms of its own financial autonomy and its legislative powers which are reserved for the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. By impinging upon the power of the State to impose taxes, the Government is violating the fundamental power of that Government. By extending GST to Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre gains effective control of the taxation in the State. That was, of course, something which was reserved by the Constitution for the State Government. The State has been dealing with conflict for a long time and we must absolutely not do anything that might harm its stability. GST tax rates are far more complicated than it needs to be. This is the Minister who told us that he was opposed to tax terrorism, instead what we are seeing is tax form terrorism. We are seeing something which obviously is going to cause a whole amount of problems, increasing works for everybody involved in business. There is a particular problem when it relates to Jammu and Kashmir. Its principle revenue generation is tourism which has been affected by terrorism. The 28 per cent GST now is going to affect all of the tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. If this is not rolled back, it is likely to make Kashmir uncompetitive in tourism. My State, Kerala has become uncompetitive in tourism because the tax rate is driving up the cost beyond any of our neighbouring States. GST has been applied at the rate of 12 per cent on highway construction which is going to come to a halt. I do want to stress finally that there is also a great threat of litigation coming up about which tax brackets, which companies fall into and how their goods should be categorised. The Government has raised the cost of many goods for GST. The current Government version of GST, I am sorry, would have a negative effect on GDP instead of a positive one and it would actually fulfil the warning of the National Institute of Public Policy. The Parliament today must contemplate the impact of GST on the Centre's relation with J&K before we make the major mistake of passing this Bill without adequate consultation with the stakeholders. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also? 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 It is a very straightforward and simple bill. Hon.Prime Minister had a dream of 'one nation, one tax'. There were many efforts in this direction. Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of all States were called. All were made aware of the importance of GST. When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir, we can understand why it was not implemented there at the same time. It was not possible because of Article 370 of the Constitution. BJP is a partner in Jammu and Kashmir Government. Why is there delay even then? We spend lakhs and crores of rupees from the consolidated fund of India in protecting Jammu and Kashmir. We provide special package. We faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. In reality, we were victorious but a part of Kashmir is still occupied by Pakistan. Pak-occupied Kashmir means our land occupied by Pakistan and terrorist camps have come up there. Terrorism is affecting us for years. We are proud of the surgical strike by our forces. We were shown the video in the Home Ministry in which our Jawans crossed the border and destroyed more than 40 terrorist camps within 12 hours. On the other hand, there is China. This is a majority government hence, Article 370 of the Constitution should be abolished. It is important to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir as well, so we are supporting this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 GST has united the fragmented tax structure and created one tax throughout the nation and now it is being extended to Jammu and Kashmir. Now with this Bill, it is truly one tax for the entire nation. With GST, India is now the single largest market in the world, not the USA or China. This Bill has been brought to replace the ordinance issued by the President on 8th July 2017 and it will extend the scope of GST to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Agriculture items are removed from the purview of GST. This is very welcome. But, there are some commodities like chillies, turmeric and red gram which are of agriculture, but the GST Council is not considering them as agriculture commodities. I request the Finance Minister to look into these and remove GST on chillies, turmeric and other non-processed and naturally processed agriculture commodities including tobacco. The proposed five per cent GST on man-made yarn, fabric and readymade garments should be removed. Input credit should not be restricted to 12 months for the builders and credit should be given for all the invoices the stocks of which were held in stock on the appointed day. GST on sanitary napkins and branded vegetables should not be there. I am surprised to see that hybrid and electric cars are being taxed even higher than petrol and diesel cars. It needs a relook. As many Members have already stated, I too feel that there are still too many rates. I would like you to consider maximum of three slabs instead of six and remove multiple slabs for same goods and services. There is still a need to bring about customer awareness on GST. Malaysia had enacted an Anti- Profiteering legislation at the time of their introduction of GST. I think that would be something that we should consider as well. At the time of bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh was promised that we would be given industrial incentives in line with Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh but now it is told to us that because of GST that is no longer going to be the case because excise duty exemption is no longer going to be possible. But now, the States are getting GST refund in lieu of those incentives. I would also like to demand, to keep up with the promises made to us and whatever is being given to hilly States like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh the same benefits should be extended to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Jammu and Kashmir is the only State that missed the 1st July roll-out date of GST and joined the new indirect tax fold making GST one-tax, one-nation regime. By providing safeguards to the special status to the State, the country has sent out a message to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that India cares for its sensitivity. The constitutional safeguards for the State as per Section 5 of the constitution of the State which empowers the State to levy tax-shall remain intact. After the roll out of the GST, textile sector in the country has been badly hit and needs to be exempted from the GST net. Otherwise, the textile sector will be uncompetitive. Items relating to disabled/handicapped persons should also be exempted from the GST. Unfortunately, the items of luxury are being prioritized instead of aids and appliances that are extremely essential for disabled persons in their routine life. There has to be a proper coordination between the Centre and States for effective implementation of GST. With these words, I support the Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 GST was rolled out throughout the nation on July 1st 2017 except Jammu and Kashmir for Constitutional reasons. Now, it is being made effective in Jammu and Kashmir as well through a Constitutional process. A number of intellectuals in the country and some of our senior Members always talk about the interests of Jammu and Kashmir but they know nothing about Jammu and Kashmir's reality. Geographically area of Kashmir valley is hardly 15 per cent of the entire Jammu and Kashmir. If we go by the population and add up the population of Jammu and Ladakh, it is many times more than that of the Kashmir valley. Whenever an issue related to Kashmir arises they talk of interests of Jammu and Kashmir. Are we concerned for only those who talk of breaking the country? I support my senior colleague from Shiv Sena. He has said that Article 370 of Constitution should be abolished. Right from the beginning of the process of GST, every party including Congress, every State has supported it. I fail to understand why Congress Party and National Conference are towing a different line on Jammu and Kashmir. They are opposing GST in Jammu and Kashmir just to serve their political purposes. It is also said that Opposition was not present at the time of passage of the Bill in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly. Why were they not present there? They themselves knew that it is in the interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. It is in the interest of nation to roll out GST in Jammu and Kashmir. GST has many benefits but there may be certain sections in Jammu and Kashmir like tourism which may be expecting certain concessions. I would request the hon.Finance Minister to consider their demand. Ladakh is a tough terrain. Cost of living is very high there. People of Ladakh are mainly engaged in tourism, hotel and small businesses. Ladakh should be, therefore, exempted from GST for 5 years. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The State of Jammu and Kashmir is a politically sensitive area and the economy of the State is fragile. When GST first came in, the notion was that it is good and there will be better tax compliance and more tax collection which is good for the nation. But after implementation of the GST, we have seen the prices of items rising and it is hurting the tax payer. Because of non-tax compliance, product prices especially in Tier II cities are much lower than in the cities. In the immediate effect, there is a dip in the Government collection. This can be very detrimental to Jammu and Kashmir. There is also a barter system in Jammu and Kashmir especially in Ladakh and other areas. Hence, special care has to be taken in this regard. Many anomalies still exist. One famous brand sells coconut hair oil with a vegetarian mark implying that it is actually edible vegetarian item. That complicates the matter. I hope that issue is resolved by the GST Sectoral Council. The GST Council should be actually working in a war footing environment and these issues should be resolved within weeks. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The fundamental principle of the GST is one nation, one tax and one market and if it has to be achieved then it will be incomplete without integration of Jammu & Kashmir. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had said that there cannot be two Prime Ministers, two flags and two Constitutions in one nation. Today we have reached the stage where we have one nation, one tax and one market. The whole country has accepted the GST. There have been more registration than the previous number of registration and if the system was not adequate then how it could have happened. It has been possible because there was adequate preparation for it. Representatives and officers of 29 states and 7 union territories took part in the GST Council meeting and determined the rates. The poor is getting the relief. Earlier, the inflation was 10-11 per cent which has come down to one and half per cent. Traders, industrialist, truck drivers and small shopkeepers came to thank me but I alone does not deserve the credit as all the state governments together with the central government passed the GST. Now, trucks will not stand stationary and transport cost will also come down. Besides, 17 taxes, 22 cesses and 1150 octrois will be removed. This will surely provide succor to the ordinary people. I am thankful to hon.Minister of Finance that despite implementation of the GST he has given relief to the hilly states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu Kashmir and North-Eastern states. This was also stated that the retailer would require 24 hours internet connection and he will have to file return 37 times. This is not true. The return has to be filed once in a month and it will get auto-generated twice. Therefore, please correct your facts. There is an arrangement in the Parliament library for Members to learn about it. This has also been stated that the ID is essential but this was clarified earlier also that the provisional ID will be final GST number. One particular political party and some other parties are deliberately trying to create confusion. GST will benefit Jammu & Kashmir and my sisters and brothers of the state will get more employment opportunities. This is a huge step for economic integration of Jammu & Kashmir. In fact, this is a fight between the consumers and the separatists and we have to decide whether we are with separatists or with the consumers. I conclude my speech supporting this Bill and congratulating hon.Finance Minister and hon.Prime Minister for it. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Several people carry out a negative campaign about the Article 370. The laws-CGST and IGST, we are enacting for the whole country, should also be extended to Jammu & Kashmir. Jammu & Kashmir assembly will decide about the state GST. 18 per cent GST rate has been levied on the synthetic yarn, majority quantity of which comes from Surat. The rich and superrich people do not use synthetic sarees. They are used by Bengali people and there is 18 per cent tax on it. Similarly, the tax rate levied on essential medicines and pharmaceuticals is not proper. There is a company which after due research had substituted the import of indigenous string. Now the string imported from China will be used in our traditional Indian instruments. Imposition of 18 per cent tax on it will eventually lead to closure of the factory. Bidi industry, transport, fireworks industry of Tamil Nadu and match-box industry also face the similar situation. The small traders with turnover above Rs.20 lakh per annum have to file their returns online and get their input tax paid by them which make it very difficult. Small, medium and tiny enterprises are also faced with similar difficulties. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Integration of Jammu & Kashmir with GST has materialized the dream of economic integration of the whole country in terms of tax. One or two hon.Members especially the Members of the Congress Party have raised the issue that this infringes upon the special status of Jammu & Kashmir. I don't think that a national level political party should indulge itself in such issues. As I have already stated that in the state of J & K, this was an augment conventionally given by the separatists that this will lead to a greater integration with India. So, do not go for GST. It was the PDP and the BJP government which was strongly advocating it. I had also expected the Congress and the National Conference to support this. I will only say that the special status was never intended to create the economic impediments for the state and that the state must economically progress in the larger interest of its people. If J & K had not integrated with GST then, the consumers and the traders of the state would not have got the input credit and the price of the products would have been higher there. Some people have been canvassing on GSTN. I explained yesterday that the GSTN has the massive job to perform. It is correct structure because about 24-25 per cent shares belong to the Central Government and the equal amount belongs to the state governments collectively. So, the company is technically not a government company. 51 per cent share have been given to HDFC, National Stock Exchange and LIC which are credible organization with a condition that the government can take over those shares and increase its own shareholdings to 51 per cent, if necessary. The Board will have a government majority. The executive will be appointed by the government and for any decision to be taken, a government's positive vote is required. I also added one more thing that GSTN will also be subjected to CAG audit. There are glitches in every system but they are always corrected. Therefore, making an issue out of GSTN is not fair. Everyone is saying that there are many slabs. If the government levies the same rate on all commodities then both the rich and the poor will pay the same amount of tax which is not proper. It was thought that there would be multiple slabs in the beginning for the sake of smooth GST. The slabs of zero per cent and five per cent would always remain there. Thirdly, there are several items which we think are not used by the common man. But now, they are being used by the middle and lower-middle class too. Hence, these should be brought below 28 per cent. I do concede that as it moves forward, there will be scope for rationalizing the rates. But if you had done it immediately and had a single slab or lesser slab, its inflationary effect would have been much higher. Maharashtra can give a refund to a Marathi film. Gujarat can give it to a Gujarati film. Tamil Nadu can give it to a Tamil film. The all-India weighted average rate of granite was twelve-and-a-half plus fourteen-and-a-half plus two plus cascading effect, 31.6. That 31.6 rate became 28. So, what is the grievance? A disability aid at zero per cent tax will be costlier but at five per cent will be the cheapest. One of the objectives of GST is that you must aid and assist domestic products. If basic Customs Duty is, let us say, 10 per cent, and the IGST is 12 per cent, then a Chinese product coming into India will have to be levied at 22 per cent. So, it will be at 22 per cent disadvantage. That disadvantage will help the growth of Make in India product. If you say that this 12 per cent should be reduced to zero, then the Chinese product will get a 12 per cent advantage. Regarding sanitary napkin, when it was fixed at 12 per cent, they said please remove it. What will happen to village self-help groups? They are all below 20 lakhs. So, they are all exempted. Those up to 75 lakhs will have to pay only two per cent. When the Indian manufacturer gets input credit, the rate actually becomes much less. Large Indian producers will pay 12 per cent minus input credit. Since the input is taxed at a much higher rate, most of it will be absorbed. Some minor tax will be left. But if you make it zero, the impact will be that every Indian manufacturer will close down. The Chinese products will become 12 per cent cheaper. I may tell that for small cards, the duty was reduced. Did the company manufacturing the hybrid cars reduce the price? They increased the actual price. Sir with these few words, I commend these Bills for approval of the House. The Statutory Resolutions were, by leave, withdrawn and the Bills were passed.
