It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard.

We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?
