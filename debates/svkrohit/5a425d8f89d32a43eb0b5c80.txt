 that the Bill to repeal the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956 and further to amend the State Bank of India Act, 1955, be taken into consideration.

 More than seventy per cent of the Indian population lives in the rural areas. A revolutionary decision of nationalising the banks took place on 19th July, 1969 because agriculture was not at all considered as one of the areas where the banks are supposed to give credit to the farmers. That was the rationale behind taking a drastic decision to nationalise the banks. The State Bank of India is now feeling as a big brother. The State Bank of Mysore, which was in existence in Karnataka, had a lot of branches in the rural areas. A lot of agricultural and subsidiary crop loans were given to the farmers by the State Bank of Mysore. But by merging that bank with the State Bank of India, the people of this country, particularly the rural people, are feeling that there is some infringement of their rights in terms of getting loans from the nationalised banks. Only the corporate sector and the bigwigs are capable of entering this bank. The common man will now feel that the State Bank of India is not his bank. There are Rs.1.8 lakh crore of NPAs in the State Bank of India. Everyone feels that NPAs are only in SBI, but it is there in all commercial banks and it is a big sum of money which has gone waste and it is at the cost of the poor people that this amount is growing. The State Bank of India is imposing some stringent conditions on customers. Nearly 31 crore people of this country are going to be affected by this stringent action by the State Bank of India with regard to keeping a minimum balance in the saving accounts. This is a very bad decision. Furthermore, the bank proposes to impose charges for cash withdrawal and also service charges. All these decisions are anti-poor. I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that people in this country, particularly the farmers are in a very critical condition. On the one hand, there is excessive rain in Northern India and on the other there is no rain in Southern India. The State of Karnataka is reeling under drought for the last five to six years. The suicide by farmers has assumed alarming proportions in this country. The Government of Karnataka took a revolutionary decision of waiving the loan of the farmers to the tune of Rs.8261 crore. I would therefore urge upon the Government of India to waive the farmers loans in the commercial banks so as to enable the farmers to breathe peacefully at least for sometimes to prevent farmers suicides in the country.

 This Bill seeks to repeal the two Acts relating to banks. These banks were subsidiaries of the State Bank of India. The Union Cabinet granted its approval in February, 2017 which allowed the SBI to acquire the subsidiaries, and the SBI Act, 1955 is further amended right now. The guiding principle for the consolidation process of banking in India has so far been as per the Narasimhan Committee recommendations. Any initiative with respect to merger of public sector banks has to come from the Board of the bank concerned. For the purposes of rationalization of resources, reduction of costs, better profitability, lower cost of funds leading to better rate of interest for public at large, improve productivity and customer service, SBI, with the sanction of the Central Government, is now having a consolidation for which these consequential amendments are required. Following the merger, total customer base of the SBI has increased to the tune of 40 crores with a branch network of 24,000 and nearly 59,000 ATMs across the country. SBI has become the largest commercial bank in India in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees. Having made this significant investment in technology, SBI is in a position to offer the widest portfolio of digital products and services. Thanks to the merger, additional customers will access and benefit through these products. The Narasimham Committee had envisaged in 1991 that the SBI should progressively merge all the seven subsidiaries with itself. Long thereafter, in 2008, the State Bank of Saurashtra was the first to merge with the SBI. Two years later, the State Bank of Indore was integrated. First, the associated banks had enjoyed a common identity with the SBI for long. Second, the SBI had been exercising the tight operational control of the associated banks from inception. Third, all associated banks were operating under the same Information Technology platform like the SBI. In 2002, it had engaged Tata Consultancy Services to roll out a core banking solution covering the entire group. So, the associated banks were beneficiaries of the common code and the linkages. Fourth, the treasury operations of the associated banks had been integrated with the SBI for several years. Lastly, the major loan decisions of the Associated Banks used to be vetted first by the SBI under centralized control before the proposals received local approval at the concerned associated Banks' Board. In Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Accounts, there is no restriction or there is no penalty for not maintaining a minimum balance. Consolidation in the banking sector is the need of the hour. Capital Adequacy Ratio for many Public Sector Banks, especially the smaller ones have been steadily declining mainly due to higher provisioning requirements for poor asset quality. It is also not possible for the Government to always step in with capital infusion into the banks due to budgetary constraints. Against this backdrop, consolidation in the banking sector assumes significance and a certain criticality with a view to salvaging the smaller and weaker PSB. On the human resource side, it will provide a larger pool of talent to tap into far ensuring better corporate governance. I would like to request our Government to open more bank branches in the rural areas. My suggestion would be that in the name of financial inclusion, which we have started now, we have to give loan to the marginal and the small famers. If the government can do something on this front, it will be appreciated. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This Bill seeks to repeal the two Acts (i) the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, and (ii) the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956. This is consequent to the Union Cabinet granting its approval in February, 2017, which allowed the SBI to acquire these subsidiaries. The State Bank of India had decided to merge the five associate banks from 1st April, 2017. SBI is India's largest bank with assets of Rs.30.72 lakh crore and figures at No. 64 in the global ranking of banks as of December, 2015. Post- merger, with assets of approximately Rs.40 lakh crore, it will be among the top 50 banks in the world. This is the first ever large-scale consolidation in the Indian banking industry. The merger will create a banking behemoth with an asset book value of Rs.37 lakh crore. There are a few things which will be significant in this merger. One is asset quality. By virtue of being the country's largest lender, the SBI is bound to have bad loans on its books. The associate banks, too, have accumulated large amounts of bad loans. Consolidation would help in better dealing with these accounts. Second is profitability. Third is technology. SBI has an active information technology department that works on a number of innovative solutions for the bank. I wish to urge upon the Government to provide adequate compensation and benefits to the employees of the associate banks who may either opt for VRS or wish to continue to serve in SBI. And I also urge upon the government to continue the services provided by these associate banks to the people of the country. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This Bill will legalize the acquisition of five banks. We are actually doing an ex post facto action of things which have already been done. I rise to say that I am not opposed to the State Bank (Repeal and Amendment) Bill. Now, having said that, why I do not support the Bill wholesale is due to three questions which I will pose before you. My question is how much money was deposited after demonetization till now? How much money has been deposited in the State Bank of India? Now, let me oppose some of the anti-people decisions of the State Bank of India. The savings bank interest rate was four per cent. Now it has been reduced to 3.5 per cent. This is an anti-people decision. Earlier, the minimum balance for a savings bank account without cheque facility was Rs.1,000 across the country. Now, the minimum balance for the metro branches will be Rs.5,000.The penalty for non-maintenance of minimum balance will between Rs.50 and Rs.100. After four withdrawals from the ATM in a month, a service charge of Rs.50 plus service tax per transaction will be applicable for basic Savings Bank Deposit Account. This step by the State Bank of India will harm altogether 31 crore people. IMPS fund transfer charges through internet banking is also an anti-people decision. I want to say that at this stage, the State Bank of India is having the biggest NPA, Non-Performing Asset. We are only hoodwinking the common people just by showing, we have done a big thing; we have merged all the banks into one. In Kerala, there was an agitation against the merger of the State Bank of Travancore. We could have opposed the Bill. We could have given resolution and amendments but that is quite pointless. This Government, with its brute majority, will bulldoze the Bill in the Lok Sabha. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I oppose this Bill. Five smaller banks are being merged with the big ocean called the State Bank of India. The Government has already put it into effect. We are only doing a post-mortem and putting our stamp on it. It is a clear move to hide the immense amount of non- performing assets that these banks have accumulated over the years. This seems to be as stopgap arrangements to prevent these five smaller banks from collapsing inwards. Given the horrible situation that exists today, by merging the smaller banks with the larger bank, you are trying to hide the bad performance of the banks. Employees, who were supposed to do due diligence and locate genuine loanees had consciously defaulted. They, from the chairmen of the banks to the bank managers, to the assessors of the bank, all have connived at some point or the other to give out bad loans, whether it is to big corporations or to companies or corporate. My positive suggestion to the Government would be that a time has come when you have to weed out the corrupt and the inefficient from the system. So, let us take steps to create a situation where we do not tax the tax-payers even more into paying for the faults of these politicians, these bureaucrats and these banks employees. Now, if these banks fail, there will be no recourse for this country, there will be no resource for the poor man. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The acquisition and amalgamation the need of the day and what will happen after the merger? There are four points, which we will achieve, namely, rationalization of resources; reduction in the cost; better profitability; lower cost of funds; ultimately, leading to better rate in interest to public at large; and improve productivity and consumer services. The question that remains to be asked here is this. Why were all these subsidiaries established in the past? The objective definitely shows that it was done in interest of public at large of this country. Further, the State Bank of India is having its own existence for India as they are having a number of branches in the country. We have seen rise of NPAs in the public sector banks but not in SBI. That is why, the new move of the Government, the amendment to the State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Bill, 2017 is very much essential and I extend full support to this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 At the outset, I would like to wish to bring to the notice of the august House that what is the purpose of merging? Because one of the stated objectives of the Government seems to be, to create a bigger bank so that we get good rankings or great ratings from the credit agencies of the world. Previously, we used to think of decentralization, now we are thinking of centralization. Today, however the picture of bank is bad loans, which is because of big people. No loans are given to the small people. There is also non- accountability aspect. I am talking about one district in the State of Telangana. They have disbursed a credit of Rs.6,750 crore. But, banks have disbursed only Rs.511 crore for the priority lending sector whereas they have disbursed the maximum amount of loan to the bigger people. I wish that the Government should take into account this aspect which is exactly affecting the poor people. The Government has gone into various pros and cons of the issue by having this merger like, reduction of the NPA, technical efficiency, international standards and so on. My only concern is that we going to miss the regional focus of the bank? So, we have to be extremely careful about it and I do want the Government of India to take up the issue. Banks are discriminating a person on the ground of profession. We wholeheartedly wish that this merger will result in a better future for the smaller people. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This Bill is anti-people, anti-farmer and it is against the parents of lakhs of students. Without any consultation and without any consideration, the Government of India decided to merge the State of Bank of Travancore into the State Bank of India. But, what is the result after the merger? In the last so many months, approvals were very much delayed. This is pushing many customers to private banks or private financers. This Bill is not only anti-people but also anti-employees and anti-officers. Pension benefit was denied to the employees of five associate banks merged in 2017. This year's promotion exercise has clearly indicated that there is no scope of promotion for erstwhile association bank employees. This has pushed many associate banks employees in a state of depression and dissatisfaction. So, it is not going to help the employees; it is not going to help the people, it is not going to help farmers. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I welcome this legislation which is aimed at repealing certain Acts relating to the State Bank of India and its erstwhile associate banks. With the merger of these banks, the Acts relating to erstwhile subsidiaries have become redundant and the State Bank of India Act requires certain modifications and those are being carried out through this legislation. Though it is slightly delayed, this Government has taken the right step in merging the State Bank of India and its associate banks. I request this Government to further identify and merge the banks and bring down the number to a reasonable level and make them competitive in the global market. Likewise, I request this Government that in the process of merger, we must ensure that none of the stakeholders like depositors, borrowers, and employees of the banks shall be adversely impacted. I would also request the Government to sympathetically consider the demands of banks pensioners. Again, Non-Performing Assets of commercial banks, especially public sector banks, have reached unacceptably high levels. So, tackling this menace is an urgent need as the integrity of the financial system is in jeopardy. I appreciate the sincerity and commitment of this Government for coming out with various initiatives for strengthening the financial systems. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In the wake of the foreign exchange crisis in the year 1991, the Narasimham Committee had recommended restructuring of banks but what is the rationality right now for the consolidation of banks? Government had already decided to merge the five subsidiaries and thereafter they have brought in this House a legislation to get it approved by the House. So, I think, this is nothing but to seriously erode the parliamentary authority of the country. Government can only consolidate or merge depending on commercial and business reasons. I would like to ask that what are the commercial perspectives or what are the business reasons which have propelled you to get the five subsidiaries to be consolidated? What sort of novelty is being brought about by the Government through the consolidation of the subsidiary banks? The corporate lobby of India has been using the SBI as a milching cow. However, like a cow, the State Bank needs to be given proper sustenance. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This Bill is related to the State Bank of India. It merges five banks of the states in SBI. This merger of five banks is unprecedented across the world in itself. This merger is a reorganization to check duplication of resources. As per a data of 2016, in terms of the home loan, car loan and personal loan provided by SBI and its five subsidiary banks, the lowest rates were offered by the SBI. As such, in the wake of this merger the consumer of this country is going to have the maximum benefit as it will increase the possibility of loan at lower interest from a major bank. The State to which I belong has a major part with tribal and naxalite affected areas. Even now, there are certain such villages over there where people have to commute 30-40 kilometers to avail the banking facilities. Welcoming this Bill, I would like to submit that new branches of the SBI may certainly be got opened in all those rural areas from where the people have to cover a lot of distance for banking services. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 With the provisions of the Bill coming into effect, the smaller banks would get merged and become a single bank and would definitely get the credibility which is required. The banks which are getting merged and the mother bank to which these smaller banks are getting merged, all are suffering from one disorder and that is NPA. Instead of treating the symptoms I would like to urge upon the Ministry of Finance to identify the disease itself. The infrastructure sector, the steel industry and the power industry are mainly causing NPA to banks. Directly or indirectly, for the NPAs being caused in these sectors, China is responsible. We have the anti-dumping mechanism in place. There are other mechanisms also in place, like there are tariff barriers, there are non-tariff barriers. That should have been invoked long back so that the NPAs would not have been caused to the level that we are faced with now. The provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code will help solve the problem of the NPAs in this country. The State Bank of India is adopting those banks which are already sick with NPAs. The health of the family needs to be improved by taking care of the disease per se and not just redressing the symptoms. Let us diagnose that instead of always blaming China as a villain. Let us also reform our own internal issues like loan waivers and others to address the issue of NPA in the interest of the nation. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The Banking system is important for the economy of the country and it is a matter of regret that even after 65 years of the country's independence, more than 50 per cent population of the country is still not connected with the banking system. I would like to congratulate the hon.Prime Minister who introduced the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana to connect the maximum part of the country with the banking system and that augmented their share in our economic development. The NPA must be classified on the basis of their causes. The deliberate ones must be recovered. 40 per cent loans have been provided for the priority sector and 60 per cent for the non-priority sector. 70 per cent people depend on the priority sector. As such, it needs to be improved. Loans should be provided for the priority sector. Secondly, it must be for the agricultural sector and in villages. Branches should be there for this purpose. Today, the farmers are under the burden of debt. That also needs to be taken seriously. There is need to improve upon the banking sector. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Today, it is high time in the country that financial institution be reformed and this is major reformatory step in that direction. This is a good initiative for the integration of subsidiary banks for strengthening the banking system. This Government has taken a number of steps which are required today in the global scenario. We must take such a concrete initiative to make the banks accountable towards the consumers. Banks are accountable for Kisan Credit Cards, but, if an overall survey is carried out in this regard, it will be found that the farmers have not been meted out a fair deal here also. Therefore, such a concrete step has been taken to change the nature of the banks, to make them accountable and consumer oriented. I welcome and support this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The interest rate in the SBI has been brought down to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent. ATM withdrawals and online transactions have been made costly. More branches of banks are required as of now, but due to this merger, the number of branches will decrease. In Punjab, the branches of the State Bank of Patiala spread over villages. However, now the number of branches will be less resulting in difficulties to the people. 88 per cent NPA is of the public sector banks. Will the Government ever have the courage to paste the photos of defaulting big industrialists in banks? 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The condition of small banks has deteriorated due to the NPAs. In the process to bring about improvement, five subsidiary banks of the State Bank i.e. State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore have been merged into the State Bank of India. It is my request that the Government may endeavour to set up the branches of the State Bank in those rural areas where its branches are not available. With regard to the charges imposed by the SBI, I would request the Government that it should be waived for the common man. I believe that if the smaller banks are merged, NPAs will certainly be reduced and we will get success in recovering the money from the big industrialists who are loan defaulters and who have fled the country. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Such a big merger is being carried out, but is our Ministry fully prepared with the equipments to run such an infrastructure? We are taking this step to fight in a global environment and I have an apprehension that such a big merger may turn out too big to handle. Are we not going to make a good bank bad by consolidating the bad banks? The rural areas in India do not have the facility of the banking sector. Wherever there is overlapping of bank branches, they will be closed down and only one branch of a bank will remain. I think that as a result of this merger, the private banks, be it HDFC, ICICI or any other bank, will have the benefit. It is necessary that such a big infrastructure be set up by the Government to be competitive for global environment so that in the times to come, the State Bank of India might be able to extend financial support wherever required in a global environment. The Government must keep a vigil that banks may not fail due to this too big to handle merger. I support this Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If an enactment is made on the basis of this Bill, I think, some positive changes can be made. Coming to the positive side, global markets will recognize India's strength in the banking sector. Efficiency of the banks can also be upgraded. The negative part of it is that it will reduce the accessibility of the common man to the banking system in our country, merger will result in closing of certain ATMs in our country. It may block even further recruitment in the banking system. It will also worsen the unemployment situation. It will have negative impact on financial inclusion and to extending the banking sector in the uncovered areas and villages. There is some kind of an execution risk also which may create a lot of confusion in the banking sector. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I rise to oppose this Bill in toto on two grounds - on technical ground and also on merits. For what purpose, the Parliament functions? The Parliament is not just for putting a stamp on the actions of the Executive. The State Bank of Hyderabad is constituted by virtue of the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956. All other four banks have been established by way of the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959. These two are the creations of the Parliament. Our creations are being taken away without informing and without getting consent of the House. I feel that it is a breach of the right of the Parliament. This is not a good practice for the Parliamentary democracy. I request and appeal to the Government to look into. I am coming on the merits. The idea behind this merger is to create a big bank of world-class size but in India we do not need very big banks. We need good banks to serve the needs of the common people. Kindly see the implications of the merger. It is observed that after the merger, SBI is having the largest share of bad debt. The Kerala Government is opposing the merger. So, I would request the Government to kindly consider it and review its decision and go back with decentralization of the banks. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I think through many Bills brought during the last three years, including GST, there is a continuous attempt by the Government to compromise with the federal principles and the federal structure of the country, to impinge upon the rights of the States and to compromise with the diversity of the States and the country. We should not centralise the powers with the Centre, may be economic or otherwise. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In the State of Kerala, State Bank of Travancore, was performing well. But now it has been merged. The service of the SBI in comparison to the SBT is very poor. It is now mandatory for the SBI account holders to maintain a balance of Rs.5,000 in metropolitan areas. For metro areas, if the difference between the minimum balance and the actual balance is 50 per cent, then the SBI charges Rs.50 plus service tax as penalty. If the shortfall is more than 75 per cent, the charges are Rs.100 excluding the service tax. People with meagre earnings will find it hard to maintain the specified balance. Thus SBI is literally robbing the depositors. So, I oppose the Bill. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The myth that the big banks are automatically strong banks has since broken by experience of failures of many big private banks worldwide, including in the USA. While the SBI as a standalone entity reported a profit a Rs.10,484 crore for the year 2016-17, the new consolidated SBI after the merger of five associate banks made a loss of Rs.390 crore for the same year. There are no short cuts to rehabilitating banks except taking strong measures for the recovery of sticky loans of State-owned banks and recapitalization of beleaguered banks. The public sector banks have to be defended and saved. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I rise to oppose this Bill for four reasons. The first reason is father technical. On 22nd February, 2017, the amalgamation of all the banks has been done by issuing various orders. This is an infringement on the rights of the entire House. Second is the result amalgamation of all State Banks is closing down of branches in the rural as well as the unbanked areas. For example, in Kerala, the branches of the State Bank of Travancore have been closed on the basis of this amalgamation. The second aspect is service charge. For the purpose of increasing profitability, the banks are imposing more service charges. The other aspect is about lending to the primary sectors, especially the agriculture sector. The banks are not providing loans to the farmers. The government has done a laudable work in terms of social security measures and mudra loans. But the banks are not giving loans to the MUDRA Banks also. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The SBI has made it mandatory that the minimum balance should be Rs.5000 in the accounts of the account holders. This is adversely affecting the people. It is an injustice to them. The SBI should immediately withdraw this order. THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Five subsidiary banks had been merged formally with the on 1st April, 2017. As a result of this merger, the SBI has become one of the 50 major banks of the world. It is ranked 45th among the major banks of the world. The total number of its customers has gone up to 37 crore. The number of its employees has also gone up from 2 lakhs to 2 lakhs 72 thousand. I have submitted this point here as many of our colleagues have expressed their apprehensions in this regard. All these apprehensions will turn out to be baseless in the times to come. We will have the benefit through this merger that the new bank will have more capital base and will be able to provide more amount of loan. It will also improve the efficiency and the facilities provided to the customer by the Bank. It will bring down the volume of inter-banking transaction saving the time required for clearing. Now, the doors of the Banks have opened up for the common man in real sense of the term and more than 29 crore people have opened their accounts in Banks so far. Out of these, 1/4th accounts have been opened with zero balance. This is a record in itself as well. During the year 2009-10, the amount of loan provided to the agricultural sector was to the tune of Rs.3 lakh 50 thousand crore which has gone up to Rs.10 lakh 65 thousand crore during the year 2016-17. We have been paying attention towards this goal on constant basis taking care of the common man. So far as the question of minimum balance is concerned, as I said just now, 1/4th out of the 29 thousand accounts have been opened with zero balance. It is our desire that every person of the country must have access to the banks. We transformed the post office into bank. As far as the question of closing down the branches of the State Bank of Travancore is concerned, the name of this bank has definitely changed, but none of its branches will be closed down. If the Members do feel the need to set up a bank branch at any place and they send it in writing, it will be considered. The RRBs are working as per their target in rural areas. Our 75 per cent lending is for the priority sector in rural areas. In fact, now this Bank will pose a challenge to the private banks as well and the SBI will function in a better way in the times to come. Some apprehensions have been expressed by our colleagues. These will be addressed, however, the merger effected has been in view of larger interest. The Bill was passed.
