 We will not only be stronger from economic point of view through 'one country, one tax' concept but we will also be able to create a sense of unity of the country. The traders who used to pay a number of taxes will get rid of them. This Bill has been introduced here with a view to ensure that the benefit in this regard may accrue to Jammu-Kashmir also along with the rest of the country. All the people of the State appreciate the positive and constructive role of the BJP on the issue of GST in the State. In fact, this is a victory of peoples' voice. The new GST regime has opened up avenues of progress for the State and the doors for stabilizing the State Exchequer. I feel that the State Cabinet has done a great national service by concurring to the adoption of the 101st Constitutional Amendment. I believe that the people will benefit from more money accruing to the State. The people of Jammu-Kashmir are happy due to it. A handful of people are there who are anti-national, separatist and supporting the stone pelters. Perhaps, they do not want us to join the mainstream through GST. With the passage of this Bill, Jammu-Kashmir will progress and will be stronger economically, it will not remain dependent upon any other and will endeavour to be self-reliant. I support this Bill.

We are happy that the J&K Assembly had taken such a positive stand and has agreed to make that State a part of the GST set up. Whether we may claim about GST, it is truly not a 'one nation one tax' as is being propounded. Let us take Gujarat as a model for GST. From the 1st of July, the traders have been on strike in most of the Mandis in Gujarat. So, new orders and outputs have also decreased in the past one month. What is happening is, unlike Malaysia and Singapore where GST has been a success, we are keeping so many levels of GST. GST network is virtually a private company. 51 per cent is held by private banks and 49 per cent by the Government. The GSTN will not only be operated by Fintex but, unfortunately, they will also be privy to each and every transaction that involves GST of companies exceeding 20 lakhs turnover. If they tabulate the data, they will be able to tell the history and the functioning of any company in this country. If a rival company comes in and says that they want to buy that data, these GSTN operators will be able to give industrial secrets which are so well-guarded by every other country. Apart from that, this network has been kept out of the purview of the C&AG. Similarly, they have also decided to keep it out of the purview of RBI. Efficiency is nowhere to be seen. Under GST regime we are again burdened with Inspector Raj from 0 to 28 per cent plus GST at various levels killing the small traders, killing the small people and killing the average businessmen. Those businessmen are Indians too. Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility for them also?
