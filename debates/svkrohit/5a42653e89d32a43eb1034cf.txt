GST Bill is a revolutionary measures. There were two Bills, particularly, two measures which the UPA initiated. One was the Constitution Amendment Bill and another revolutionary measure was to replace the outdated Income Tax Act by introducing the Direct Taxes Code. These are the fundamental, innovative changes which were proposed. In fact, that would have added up to 2 to 3 per cent to the GDP. That means, you have a revenue deficit of 3 per cent today. The Income Tax Act itself is a colonial Act. It is not a progressive legislation. We need to address all these questions. Many a time, bureaucracy, both in the administration and in the taxation sector, are always against the change that has now this country is suffering today. I am at least happy that you have moved forward on GST. As far as commoners or taxpayers and market is concerned, this will definitely have the cascading effect. I think, this is a matter which has a substantive character and this needs to have been discussed in the Standing Committee. So, we will have to consider this very seriously. With regard to 2011 Bill, there is a fundamental difference. The present Bill says that there should be voting. How will in a federal system the voting takes places? It will affect the States. This can create a lot of confusion and complication. In our Bill, we have provided for a mechanism. Creation of a mechanism called the Dispute Settlement Authority- that has been removed. Instead of a mechanism, you have straight away introduced the voting system. Pulling each other; complexities and ultimately decision will not be objective. This should have been discussed in the Standing Committee. Some of the States may be marginalized tomorrow. Restriction relating to imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods has been deleted by the present Bill. This will lead to a lot of complications tomorrow. The Bill deletes the provision which permits states to tax entry of goods into a local area. There is no unanimity even today by the Empowerment Committee. You just forgotten the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments. How do you provide the resources to the local bodies, the district councils, the municipalities? It is not a small deviation but it makes a fundamental change in the original Bill and also this Bill. It would have been very well analyzed by the Standing Committee. After the amendments, which are passed by both the Houses, it has to get the approval of 50 per cent of the States. I do not think the Empowered Committee had gone into both positive and negative impact of this Bill because they are not supposed to do that. I think GST is being practiced in about 140 countries. We could have borrowed the experience of those 140 countries. It is not that we are implementing GST for the first time in the world. I think, there will be a lot of confusions. Our own then government also failed on retrospective taxation. Even after you created a perception of good investment climate, things have not improved, because fundamentally government has not made changes. DTC and GST are two important pillars for a game changer in this country. If you forego that, perhaps you will have to regret tomorrow. Government will have to ensure whether GST is an improvement over VAT. There are 101 counts which I can demonstrate to the hon.Finance Minister, and it is a fit case to be sent to the Standing Committee. India should be in the frontline in the superb countries, some of these taxation measures will be the basic things. With signing of free trade agreements, need for nationwide simple and transparent system of taxation is further enhanced. I welcome GST but not this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The country felt the need for a better taxation system since years. A modified form of GST Bill has been introduced in this House on which most of the states gave their concurrence. This Bill will save the country from a labyrinth of taxation. This type of taxation system will lead to nation's economic growth. This has already been debated in detail in the Standing Committee. At least 144 countries have adopted the GST system. GST system will add to our GDP growth, benefit the farmers and make goods cheaper for the common man. Analyst and economists agree that with the implementation of GST there will be saving of at least 30 per cent of time in transportation and price goods will fall at least 30 to 40 per cent. Industries will only develop when taxation is simplified. It is a revolutionary step to end corruption. It is evident from experience that when a businessmen has to pay 16 different types of taxes in different places it leads to corruption. It is a revolutionary Bill. It is the dream of the Prime Minister to bring about an improvement in the life of the 125 people. Regarding the levy of 1 per cent additional tax it is only for two years for those states where production takes place. The loss of revenue to the state with the implementation of the GST will be compensated by the centre for five years as per different slabs. There is also a provision for review of this Bill. Most of the States want its implementation. In the council the States will have 2/3rd voting shares and Centre will have 1/3rd voting shares. The House should pass this Bill and cooperative in introducing the GST system- the unified tax system from 1 April, 2016. This Bill prove to be the milestone in the progress of the country. While supporting this Bill. I profusely thank the hon.Minister of Finance and the hon.Prime Minister for bringing this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to oppose as well as to voice our party's this Bill in its present form. We are not averse to reforms in any subject if they are pro-poor and the aim is public god. We are opposing this legislation because it has not taken into account the views of all the stakeholders. GST is a contentious issue not only in India but the worldwide. We all know that elections were lost and later won on the GST issue in Australia. In Tamil Nadu's case, we have a conservative estimate loss of Rs.10,000 crore per fiscal in addition to the revenue loss arising out of phasing out of PSP and transfer of Input Tax Credit and other taxes. Taxing shipping from the point of origin to the point of destination has created a piquant situation of huge and recurring revenue loss to the State. Tamil Nadu is opposed to the idea of the GST Council as a Constitutional body as it compromises the autonomy of the States including in fiscal matters. Presently 21 per cent of our sales tax revenue is only from petroleum products. Bringing these products under the ambit of GST will curtail the taxation powers of the States and entail huge revenue losses. We, therefore, urge that the petroleum products be totally kept out of the purview of the GST. States should also be given similar power as the centre to levy higher tax over and above SGST on tobacco products. The other thing is revenue loss due to CST to the extent of Rs.3,500 crore per annum if GST is implemented. Amendment Bill empowers the Government of India to exempt goods from this additional levy of one per cent. This is a temporary provision and will not compensate the State for permanent losses. We urge the Centre to provide 100 per cent compensation to the States for the entire period of five years. The transition of GST is not going to be easy. Once the GST is rolled out, the cost of services is going to increase substantially. Our humble request to the Government is, kindly seize this opportunity and take on board all stakeholders and bring out a fine piece of legislation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are supporting this Bill but we have some suggestions and some requests. There are still some major concerns of the State that have not been appropriately addressed. So far as the GST compensation is concerned, it was unanimously agreed that the State should be compensated by the Government of India for loss of revenue for at least five years. We are strongly of the view that this should be guaranteed by the Constitution itself. Goods and service tax should not be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, petrol, natural gas, and aviation turbine fuel at least in the initial period as presently these items are taxed at higher rates and constitute a major source of revenue for the States. The States should be allowed to impose sales tax over and above GST on tobacco and tobacco products. Since the revenue of the States will depend on the inter-state transactions, they must have the authority to verify the transactions. So, for providing a legal framework, it is absolutely necessary that the relevant enabling clause should be added to the proposed Article 269A as was earlier recommended by the Empowered Committee. I would like to emphasis that GST can only succeed provided the States are financially strong. This is particularly important to keep the federal structure intact and empower the States to effectively meet their development and infrastructural responsibilities.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This idea of GST will be a game- changer, making the whole country one market. It would help not only the traders, it will also help the consumers to a great extent. In this new Bill, there are certain areas that vitiate the principles of GST. For example in Clause 18 of the Bill one per cent on the supply of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce has been prepared. When already the loss for the States has been compensated, then why do you have a one per cent more? Initial proposal to set the GST is at 27 per cent which is indeed very disconcerting. A high GST rate will be unviable for the economy that would lead to a significant inflationary pressures. There are four issues which need to be addressed. First is relating to the CST compensation. The commitment which was given by the previous Government was not kept. Odisha is suffering from loss on account of reduction in CST rate. Now, the Government has brought it into the Bill to make it legal. Why does the Government not start the release of money? It would infuse confidence. My second point is about the Green Tax. Under GST, the Destination Principle applies and the mineral producing States where pollution is localized do not get any part of the revenue. It is only the consuming States that gets the tax revenue, whereas the pollution is suffered by the citizens of the producing States. I have proposed for the levy of an additional non-rebatable cess subject to suitable framing of guidelines. I would like to suggest that there should be a new entry in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. This would go a long way in mitigating the problem the mineral bearing states would have to bear because of pollution. Thus, the mineral rich State may impose Green Tax outside GST on despatch of minerals. It would be put in the Bill so that it becomes a national Act and it becomes binding on others. Tobacco and tobacco products should be included in entry of the State List so as to enable the States to levy higher rate of tax on it. The fourth Point is the decision of the GST Council. The Union Government should have weightage of one-fourth of the total votes cast and all the States should have weightage of three-fourths of the votes cast and the decision should be taken by three-fourths majority. So that the possibility of the Union Government vetoing the decision of the states which under the present structure, is a possibility and be ruled out. For minerals despatched companies these branches outside the state, not CST is collected. It should be bought into GST fold.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I place on record my sincere thanks to the hon.Finance Minister for bringing forward such a Bill which may remove the existing complicated tax structure and pave the way to legislate the uniform tax structure around the country. GST will replace all indirect taxes levied on goods and services by the Indian Central and State Governments. The above Amendment Bill seeks to omit Entry 52 of the State List of the Constitution of India. Entry 52 empowers the Municipal Corporation is levy taxes on the entry of goods into local area for consumption, use or sale therein. Due to omission, the powers vested with the Municipal Corporation to levy such taxes would be eliminated; thereby the present source of revenue by way of octroi would not be available which would have adverse impact on the Municipal Corporation's revenue income. Due to omission of Entry 52 of the Constitution of India, the financial autonomy of the urban local bodies will be jeopardized. Mayor of the Metro City shall be made in Member of the GST Council. In Clause 19, the word 'may' be substituted by the world 'shall' and after the word 'States', the world 'Urban Local Bodies' shall be inserted, and in place of the world 'five, the word 'ten' shall be substituted.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GST would definitely pave the way for smooth tax administration. With one stroke of the GST Bill, our country would become a very attractive destination. I feel that there is a need to create IRS (GST) All India Service. The GST officers can go to the States and administer the State GST and the Central GST also very effectively because these are the CBEC IRS officers who are well trained in the indirect taxation, indirect tax collections and they understand the notifications and litigations. At the adjudication stage, it is not very clear in the Bill, where the appellate authority, how the adjudication process will take place and how it is going to be resolved. The limit of Rs.10 lakh, which is envisaged in the proposed Bill, we doubt whether it is going to be misused. If that happens, instead of expecting 1.2 or 1.5 per cent GDP growth, we may lose that much back. This is the Bill which is making history in India after 1947 to make India economically very strong. I think this is one of the historic Bills to reduce the common man's burden of purchasing the goods and services from the market. Businessmen are also looking for a lot of industrial growth, a lot of industrial setting up so that employment generation also will increase. The country is going to get benefited with the introduction of GST. I also besiege upon all my colleagues, let us support the GST Bill. By deferring it or by sending it to the Standing Committee, we are going to lose one year. Let us make tax administration also as smooth as possible by utilizing the best services of the Central Board of Excise and Customs.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GST is indeed a positive reform and has the potential of enhance the economy of the country and of the individual states. Further, it will enhance enforcement and collection of taxation. The GST will encourage supply chain mechanism which is tax compliant and self- enforcement. This will also ensure that corruption is reduced. However, I have several reservations. One of the issues is the one per cent inter-State transfer tax. This one per cent actually sometimes translates but it is upto 10 per cent. We definitely need to review it. Its effect on certain industries is very detrimental. Also the exclusion of real estate will mean no credit will be allowed for taxes paid on inputs such as steel, cement, etc. It will also dilute the benefits of GST in this industry. As I said, it is not just an economic tool, it can bring about social changes. I would like to draw the attention of the House to a very sensitive matter. India is fast becoming alcoholic. In many States, in excess of 15 per cent of the State annual revenues is coming from alcohol-related items. The States should be allowed to charge special taxes at a very high rate because they control harm as well as it raises revenue for the states. The Bill misses a great opportunity to bring about a social change. At present, tax on alcohol is based on the price of alcohol. It is not based on the quantity of alcohol. So, I think, this GST Bill misses an opportunity to change this from a price-based tax to a quantity-based tax. This needs to be reviewed. Unless all these issues, including one per cent inter-State tax and consensus of the Council versus voting, we cannot support this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There must be some provisions to compensate the States for certain period for their revenue loss. There are some States having their resources, minerals etc, but they are not the manufacturing or consuming States. So, those States would be losing the revenue. Therefore, all the States should be looked after and get the benefit. Secondly, it is proposed in the Bill about the formation of a GST Council. This GST Council should be empowered by the legislation. Unless the States are empowered and benefited; and if the taxes and revenue would not flow to the States, how would the very fundamental programmes be undertaken by the States? With regard to alcohol, there should be some thought given to it whether alcohol and other related products should be brought under the collective net. I would recommend that this Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee. The Finance Minister of that particular State is the Chairman of the empowered Committee. This is a good gesture. But there should be some propriety. So, it should be chaired by someone else. In the 73rd and 74th Amendments, the local bodies are empowered to raise some resources for their development and for other things. In this Bill, there is no clarity on that. So, I think this issue should be discussed further.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The temporary exclusion of petroleum, crude and other products may not be advisable because it may lead to inflation. So these products may be included in this Bill. The tobacco is a part of the GST base but the Centre alone can levy special excise duty. Therefore, there is inequality between the Centre and the States and that inequality could be avoided. In other countries, GST ranges from three per cent to ten per cent whereas India is proposing to have twenty seven per cent. Have the taxes being taxed by various States been taken into consideration where GST regime is being introduced? Government should consider continuation of special rates on the processed food in certain backward areas. Government should also consider merit rates on certain items. Also, there is no clarity on taxation on work contracts, software and intangible things. That also needs certain clarification. I request the Government bring alcohol into GST regime as early as possible. The next most important things is the automatic compensation mechanism. What most of the States are observing is that the Central Government will compensate States for loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the GST for a period up to five years. But what would happen after five years? Therefore, to make it a harmonized structure and ensure a uniformed market, an automatic compensation mechanism should be evolved. The other important issue is that the States should be given opportunity to have additional resources in case of natural calamities and disasters. At the time of implementation of GST, the concerns of Special Category States may also be taken into consideration. In my view, a proper monitoring and evaluation cell should be created as soon as possible to make the GST effective and to study its impact on GDP, inflation and other aspects of economy. The Centre should also provide technical assistance to the States particularly for e- filing of tax returns.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Maharashtra has been one of the most forthcoming and progressive States. We are also one of the manufacturing States and we also have concerns. I want to clear this right at the beginning that we are not against GST. There are only a few clarifications that I will ask the hon.Finance Minister to make so that we feel reassured because this entire Bill is very Centre-oriented. Are we sure that in 11 months all States will be on par in an administrative matter of implementation? A lot of people have talked about revenue-neutral rate, which is definitely a concern. We are all happy to pay taxes, but if they are going to be at a ridiculous rate of 27 per cent it will bring hardship. I would urge the hon.Minister to look for solutions, and if he can bring it down. If you really want to bring more people into the tax net, then it has to be a realistic number. What GST benchmark the Government going to look at? So, I would ask the hon.Minister to clarify this. Another query, which we are concerned about is dual authority. What is going to be the benchmark of dual taxation: So, we would like the hon.Minister to clarify about it because we do not want dual authority. Let the States take a certain level, and above that let the Centre take over. But our State's recommendation should be respected, and that is all that we are urging for.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A simplified taxation system would be implemented in the country with the implementation of GST which would be transparent, will help in growth of the GDP and promote the economic growth rate of the country. Most of the apprehensions are regarding the share of the states. This Bill should have come by 2010. There was a trust deficit between the Union Government and the state governments. This government has tried to eliminate this trust deficit. The provisions in the Bill do not leave any room for apprehensions on the part of the state governments. The present system of taxation has given rise to trust deficit between the general public and the Union Government as well. The complexity of the taxation procedure has led to the saying, 'tax is terror'. GST would give relief from this terror. The trust deficit would be filled up. People would become participants, pay taxes of their own volition, the tax net would become wider and the taxation rates would also rise. Discussion has been held on demand for grants for six Ministries. Most of the hon.Members supported the demand for increase in grants during the discussion regarding each Ministry. The new GST law would prove useful from this point of view.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The aim of the Finance Minister of a Welfare state is not to accumulate money rather its objective is to provide facilities to the people. The present GST Bill will simplify the things, make the goods cheaper and check pilferage and corruption. The previous Government had once waived Rupees 70 thousand crores of loans due on the farmers. The worst affected by debt burden is the farmer of Punjab if the figures of per family, per house and per acre of land are taken, but the loan waived was the lowest in case of Punjab. Thus, we have a doubt that just as discrimination was done last time in case of disbursement of funds, the same should not repeat while accumulating funds and at the time of disbursement. I have another doubt. The Hon.Finance Minister has said that the Union Government "may compensate". I want an amendment in this regard by making it "shall compensate". The period of five years fixed for compensating in case of tax collection should be increased to 15 years or at least made 10 years. The states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have been included in the special provision of G.S.T Council. I would request to include Punjab in the same also.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Goods and Services Tax is a welcome move. It has become necessary that taxation method facilitates ease of doing business for local as well as international companies. Since GST is a destination tax it will be beneficial for many consumer States. There are concerns for the manufacturing states for fear of losing out on revenue because of the new tax regime. If the GST is to be implemented in true spirit, all the additional taxes like Mandi tax and the R&D tax which are kept out of the purview of the GST have to be subsumed in the GST. Real estate has been kept out of the GST. I hope that the Government will keep in mind its agenda of Make In India and the need to boost exports before deciding the GST rates. The global average of GST or VAT is 16.4 per cent. This would not be beneficial for Indian manufacturers and exporters as they will be directly competing against the countries which have lower tax rates compared to India.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The introduction of Value Addition Tax at the Centre and the States was one of the major improvements in post- Independence India. Customers and traders are all being burdened with so many taxes. So, definitely it is the need of the hour that there should be a uniform pattern of tax structure not only in indirect tax sector but in direct tax sector also. GST is not simply a VAT plus service tax but it is an improved form of the existing system of VAT. The first clarification I would like to have from the hon.Minister is regarding alcohol and petrol. The long pending demand of almost all the States is that alcohol and petrol should be exempted from the imposition of GST. But the 73rd Committee Report stated that no goods should be constitutionally kept outside the purview of GST. The revenue concerns of the States have not been taken into consideration in respect of petrol. I appreciate the fact that alcohol is exempted. Similarly, petrol has to be exempted from the purview of GST. I urge upon the Government for devolution of net proceeds of Integrated GST also to be done through the Finance Commission, not by legislation by the Union Government.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today's moment is a historical moment. Today commitment and determination of enforcing Goods and Service Tax (GST) is proving to be a milestone for securing financial freedom for every citizen of the country. Whereas this move reflects the original spirit of our constitution, on the other hand it will create new history by making the tax regime both at Central and State level transparent and effective through collection of high revenue. This amendment is the most important, revolutionary, reformist and historical step of this decade. I recall Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had envisaged GST in the year 2003. He, therefore, constituted Kelkar Committee for this. Kelkar Ji stated in that committee that Integrated Tax System is of paramount importance. As a result thereof, India's tax structure being one of the poorest Tax Structures in the world, was turned into an excellent tax structure in the world. I think that this bill has been the most discussed Bill after independence history of the nation. There will be good coordination among states due to input tax credit in GST collection. Obviously, inflation increases when tax is imposed one after the other but now it will come down. I think that whereas single market system will become certainty on the other hand accountability and monitoring will increase and black money will be checked. Most important thing is that information technology will be used which will not only stop theft but also increase the Tax collection. Inspector regime will totally disappear by registering all products manufactured from raw materials in computers. It will simplify the indirect taxes. Excise and Service Tax would be cheaper. Implementing GST certainly boosts the Samradh Bharat and Shreshtha Bharat, Make in India, Skill India, Digital India Missions of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji. The GDP is likely to increase by two percent as a result thereof. Complication of Tax would be diminished from Integrated System. I also like to state that we will go ahead in the world. We can trust that our growth rate would cross two digit in forthcoming years. Foreign Investment would definitely increase because today around one hundred fifty countries have GST. Investors go to other countries like China, Thailand, Vietnam due to our complicated Tax System. At the end, I would like to say that for clarifying doubts, if any, council has been constituted and states have got 66 percent representations therein. Finance Minister has already said about compensation and provision of around Rs.34 thousand crores has been made. I would like to request only one thing that there should be proper monitoring on border areas.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I felt that the hon.Finance Minister should clarify two things in the Bill. Firstly, the success of the GST system is largely dependent on the width of its coverage. But the proposed GST regime has excluded many items such as potable alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products which account for a large chunk of indirect tax base in the country. Secondly, the one per cent extra levy has been proposed to be charged when goods move from one State to another. Every time goods move from one State to another and the tax will go on increasing, it will have a cascading effect on the cost in the supply chain. Sir, I have given three amendments which are in the interest of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Our Puducherry unit of the party had studied the Bill and had given some suggestions. They are thankful about the fact that the Government has accepted their suggestion to insert a new article 366 (26b) in the definition clause for State which includes a Union Territory with Legislature with reference to article 246 (a), 268, 269 (a) 279 (a). The provision of the current Bill does not pave way for devolution of Union revenue constitutionally under article 275 and 280, that is through Central Finance Commission. So my amendment is with regard to the inclusion of article 270, 275 and 280 in the definition of State for the purpose of devolution of revenue from Central pool. Secondly, article 279 (a) clause 4 (g) provides for Goods and Services Council to make recommendations to the Union and the States on special provisions with respect to certain States. My amendment to this sub-clause (g) is to include Puducherry in the list of States and UTs. The Legislature of Puducherry has been consistently demanding Statehood and special status for a long time. Hence, Puducherry should be included in the special provision States. Thirdly, Section 18(2) of the Bill excludes Union Territory with Legislature from the share of one per cent additional tax on supply of goods for two years or such other period recommended by the GST Council. Puducherry UT's revenue should be protected in the transition period from VAT regime to GST regime. Hence, my amendment to Section 18(2) to insert the words 'without Legislature' along with Union Territories.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two problems with the one per cent additional tax. Since the States are anyway to be compensated for their losses, there is really no rational explanation for why the one per cent tax had to be introduced. Secondly, the tax may not end at the end of two years since the Bill says that the period can be extended by the GST Council. Since the real benefits of the GST will flow only once tax rates get lowered, the presence of the one per cent tax will only add to the overall costs. According to Section 18 of the Bill, one per cent tax is to apply to all supply of goods and not sales. In other words, if there are branch/stock transfers within a company across State boundaries, the tax will be applicable to this. Given the large number of inter-State transfers within firms, this could raise the tax level to as high as five per cent. An equally big problem is relating to real estate. Since this has been kept out of the GST, this means that there will be input tax credit on items like cement and steel that are used in the construction sector. Given how construction capital expenditure is around 35-40 of all capital investment in the country, this is a very big area that is being kept out. Until all the economy is covered by the GST, and this will take years, the 2 per cent benefit being talked about is not going to materialize and the 1 per cent type taxes will only add to the delay. I do not know why this Government is hell bent upon not sending the legislative document to the Standing Committee for the scrutiny. I would like to share the concern of the State Governments. The Telangana Finance Minster has told the Central Government that it must pay compensation to States for the abolition of Central Sales Tax before going ahead with the Goods and Services Tax. Odisha Government has demanded the Centre to release Central Sales Tax loss amount of Rs.3,255 crore before implementation of the proposed Goods and Services Tax in the country. Haryana and Punjab are opposed to the proposal to subsume purchase tax in GST, arguing that it will lead to revenue losses. Maharashtra and Gujarat are for levying an additional tax on production beyond two years and have also demanded that this tax be increased to two per cent. Mizoram, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have demanded that they be allowed to levy higher taxes on tobacco and tobacco products similar to the Central Government. Tamil Nadu said that the Centre should evolve a consensus on various aspects of GST like taxes before pushing the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. The BJP Government, both at the Centre and in States, had vehemently opposed the GST announced by the UPA Government and is now for its passage in this House.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to congratulate Hon.Minister of Finance for having brought in a revolutionary bill after 1947, in which more than 16 different taxes have been clubbed into one bouquet. India is reeling under the problem of black money for many years and corruption had, in fact, brought a policy paralysis in the economy of our country in the last ten years. This bill, if passed, will give impetus to our economy and provide a common market system to the people in place of a number of indirect taxes. This type of system is already prevailing in more than 150 countries in the world. In order to study the prevailing system, a committee, comprising of Finance Ministers of the states of our country had also visited Australia, Brazil and other countries. The implementation of GST will definitely augur well for the businessmen, employees, service sector, economy as well as consumers. Earlier, the Delhi Government had also opined that different types of tax systems create many problems and only one- third of tax is collected which gives rise to the black money. This has also been supported by FICCI. I support this bill. The discussion was not concluded.
