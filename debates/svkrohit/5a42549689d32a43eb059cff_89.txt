++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Jammu and Kashmir is the only State that missed the 1st July roll-out date of GST and joined the new indirect tax fold making GST one-tax, one-nation regime. By providing safeguards to the special status to the State, the country has sent out a message to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that India cares for its sensitivity. The constitutional safeguards for the State as per Section 5 of the constitution of the State which empowers the State to levy tax-shall remain intact. After the roll out of the GST, textile sector in the country has been badly hit and needs to be exempted from the GST net. Otherwise, the textile sector will be uncompetitive. Items relating to disabled/handicapped persons should also be exempted from the GST. Unfortunately, the items of luxury are being prioritized instead of aids and appliances that are extremely essential for disabled persons in their routine life. There has to be a proper coordination between the Centre and States for effective implementation of GST. With these words, I support the Bill.

GST has united the fragmented tax structure and created one tax throughout the nation and now it is being extended to Jammu and Kashmir. Now with this Bill, it is truly one tax for the entire nation. With GST, India is now the single largest market in the world, not the USA or China. This Bill has been brought to replace the ordinance issued by the President on 8th July 2017 and it will extend the scope of GST to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Agriculture items are removed from the purview of GST. This is very welcome. But, there are some commodities like chillies, turmeric and red gram which are of agriculture, but the GST Council is not considering them as agriculture commodities. I request the Finance Minister to look into these and remove GST on chillies, turmeric and other non-processed and naturally processed agriculture commodities including tobacco. The proposed five per cent GST on man-made yarn, fabric and readymade garments should be removed. Input credit should not be restricted to 12 months for the builders and credit should be given for all the invoices the stocks of which were held in stock on the appointed day. GST on sanitary napkins and branded vegetables should not be there. I am surprised to see that hybrid and electric cars are being taxed even higher than petrol and diesel cars. It needs a relook. As many Members have already stated, I too feel that there are still too many rates. I would like you to consider maximum of three slabs instead of six and remove multiple slabs for same goods and services. There is still a need to bring about customer awareness on GST. Malaysia had enacted an Anti- Profiteering legislation at the time of their introduction of GST. I think that would be something that we should consider as well. At the time of bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh was promised that we would be given industrial incentives in line with Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh but now it is told to us that because of GST that is no longer going to be the case because excise duty exemption is no longer going to be possible. But now, the States are getting GST refund in lieu of those incentives. I would also like to demand, to keep up with the promises made to us and whatever is being given to hilly States like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh the same benefits should be extended to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
