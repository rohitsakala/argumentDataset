 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised.

GST has united the fragmented tax structure and created one tax throughout the nation and now it is being extended to Jammu and Kashmir. Now with this Bill, it is truly one tax for the entire nation. With GST, India is now the single largest market in the world, not the USA or China. This Bill has been brought to replace the ordinance issued by the President on 8th July 2017 and it will extend the scope of GST to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Agriculture items are removed from the purview of GST. This is very welcome. But, there are some commodities like chillies, turmeric and red gram which are of agriculture, but the GST Council is not considering them as agriculture commodities. I request the Finance Minister to look into these and remove GST on chillies, turmeric and other non-processed and naturally processed agriculture commodities including tobacco. The proposed five per cent GST on man-made yarn, fabric and readymade garments should be removed. Input credit should not be restricted to 12 months for the builders and credit should be given for all the invoices the stocks of which were held in stock on the appointed day. GST on sanitary napkins and branded vegetables should not be there. I am surprised to see that hybrid and electric cars are being taxed even higher than petrol and diesel cars. It needs a relook. As many Members have already stated, I too feel that there are still too many rates. I would like you to consider maximum of three slabs instead of six and remove multiple slabs for same goods and services. There is still a need to bring about customer awareness on GST. Malaysia had enacted an Anti- Profiteering legislation at the time of their introduction of GST. I think that would be something that we should consider as well. At the time of bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh was promised that we would be given industrial incentives in line with Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh but now it is told to us that because of GST that is no longer going to be the case because excise duty exemption is no longer going to be possible. But now, the States are getting GST refund in lieu of those incentives. I would also like to demand, to keep up with the promises made to us and whatever is being given to hilly States like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh the same benefits should be extended to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
