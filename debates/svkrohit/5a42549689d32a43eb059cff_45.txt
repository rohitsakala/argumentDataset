 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this.

It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard.
