 Of course, there is provision in our Constitution that under Article 123 the Government may resort to Ordinance route. But when we are having access to Parliament, we should not frequently resort to Ordinance route. Here lies the problem. The Government has failed to impress upon the State Government of Jammu & Kashmir to get incorporated in the national tax regime which started rolling out from 1st July. The fact remains that nearly 50 per cent of our GDP still remains out of the ambit of the GST. Given the sensitivity of the Jammu & Kashmir region, I think the Government should have better prepared before introducing this tax regime. There is an apprehension in the minds of the people of Kashmir Valley that whether GST and SGST will harm the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. So, the Government should clear its position in this regard. In India, Jammu and Kashmir is the only State where both service tax and goods tax can be levied by the State Government itself. This facility is not available to other states of India. When this issue was raised in Jammu and Kashmir, there was a severe agitation. Therefore, the Government should strive hard to allay their apprehension and fears and see that the special status, the fiscal autonomy and other facilities enjoyed by the people of the Valley should never be compromised.

It is a matter of price that a landmark tax reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax has been successfully rolled out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, with effect from 1st July 2017. Check post and various declaration forms will now be a thing of the past. It is a matter of pride that the decision in all the 19 meetings of the GST Council under the chairmanship of the hon.Finance Minister has so far been only through consensus. Fireworks industry, which is largely located in Tamil Nadu, is a labour intensive industry, employing more than eight lakh people. The present rate of GST is at 28 per cent, and it will cost irreparable harm to this sector and the cottage industry. Hence, there should be a reduction in the rate of GST on fireworks. As regards the textile sector, it is requested that the handloom, the powerloom and all job works relating to them may be exempted from tax. I would also urge the hon.Finance Minister to look into the grievances of manufacturers and traders who carry out their business in the rural areas. The arrears receivable from the Government of India as of August, 2017 in respect of CST compensation of Tamil Nadu is to the tune of Rs.4,988.67 crore. I expect a positive reply from the hon.Finance Minister in this regard.
