The Factories Act of 1948 is a comprehensive Act. The Central legislation is for safety, health and welfare of labourers as also working hours and regulations of their working condition. The Factories (Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in 2014 including Sections 64 and 65 for the enhancement of working hours. Subsequently, this Bill was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee, which has also submitted its Report. Now, a comprehensive Amendment Bill on Factories Act 1948 is under consideration. The proposed amendments are with respect to Section 64 which indicates enhancement of overtime from 50 hours to 100 hours in a quarter and Section 65 which indicates enhancement of overtime from 75 hours to 125 hours in a quarter. I am mentioning this enhancement of hours because 145 hours in a quarter is described in ILO. That is why, I am proposing less than what the ILO has ratified. Moreover, in Sections 64 and 65 - to make rules and orders, the rights and powers of the State Governments are not being taken away anywhere. It will also ensure uniformity and its application in the entire State Governments and in UTs. That is why, I would like to request this august House to consider and pass this Bill, which will give a boost the manufacturing sector.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is not appropriate to bring this legislation to amend only two sections of the main Act in the name of labour reforms as a comprehensive Bill on this subject is already pending. Despite the fact that the report presented by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour is under examination, I fail to understand the reasons for hurry in amending only two sections. It also goes beyond my understanding how the employment is going to increase just by increasing the working hours of the existing workers. This will only increase the burden of the existing employees. You could have brought it in the main Act itself. Even the powers of the State Governments are also being taken away through this Bill. Labour is a subject of Concurrent List and hence the states should also have been consulted in this regard. The labourers should not be exploited in the name of Make in India, ease of doing business and liberalization. Therefore, I would like to request the hon.Minister to withdraw this Amendment Bill and bring a fresh Bill in the next Session.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a very important Bill which is really in favour of labourers. The Factories Act, 1948 was the first Act enacted for the welfare of labourers after Independence. This has undergone several amendments from time to time, but in reality, this has not turned out to be effective for the welfare of the labourers. This is because the erstwhile government has not paid much attention to this issue. Under this amendment, the overtime is proposed to be increased. Under Section 64, an employee is given 50 hours overtime in three months time period and if the employee works for extra hours as overtime then the factory owner is not liable to pay beyond the upper ceiling of the overtime. Therefore, hon.Minister has made this provision. Employees work on overtime out of their own volition and get the payment at double rate. The leader of the Opposition party wants that they should not progress. It is now incumbent upon the factory owner to ensure a conducive environment in the factory and if the temperature inside the factory is not in permissible range then the factory owner will be liable for punishment. Under a new provision, uniform, safety and safe drinking water is the responsibility of the factory owner. The leader of the main Opposition party was saying that this Bill could have been brought in the next session. They did not bring such a labour friendly Bill in last forty years as they do not have any concern for workers. I would request the hon.Minister to bring another Bill to ensure payment of minimum wages to every worker and a plate specifying the norms relating to minimum wages should be displayed at the gate of factory. Hon.Prime Minister has stated that every worker will be self-reliant in the country by the year 2021.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bill amends and specifies the definitions of a factory, hazardous process, manufacturing process, and also hazardous substance and disability. The Factories Act, 1948 permits the State Governments to make rules regarding any matter. But, according to the present Bill, the power of the State Governments to make rules will be restricted to matters where the Central Government does not have such powers. This is really unwarranted and the Centre should not interfere in the State Governments' rights as it will destroy the federal structure. The Union Government instead of bringing the Bill in a piecemeal form, should discuss with the State Government and seek their opinions to bring in an comprehensive Bill. I would like to know the reasons for bringing the Bills in haste without seeking opinion from the State Governments. Protecting the interests of every single employee is the indispensable duty of the employer.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is an anti labour Bill and slowly this Government is interfering with the federal structure of this country. As far framing of rules is concerned, the primacy has been given to the Central Government and the State Government is coming later on. Central Government will make the rules on the industry. But implementing agencies will be the chief inspector and inspectors, the responsibility would be that of state. Now I come to the second point regarding the increase of the overtime period. It will adversely affect the health condition of the workers. If overtime is needed, why should the Government not create scope for new employment? The hon.Labour Minister has referred to the International Labour Organization's recommendations but let him tell me whether the condition in any factory in England, America, Canada or Switzerland similar to ours. Therefore, the ILO's recommendation is neither mandatory nor compulsory. It is dependent on the conditions of the country where it is implemented. If the Government continues with overtime, the unemployment problem will be aggravated and new employment scope will not be there. Therefore, this is a Bill which I oppose. Not a single trade union of West Bengal is in favour of increasing the overtime in this way. I was telling the hon.Minister that nobody wants it. Under whose pressure the Government is working? I say that this is an anti-labour Bill which amounts to interference with the federal structure of this country.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is clear and evident from the clauses of the Bill, possibly the Government is working overtime to infringe upon the autonomy of the State as a whole. The hon.Minister of Labour and Employment has stated three things. Firstly, this amendment will boost manufacturing. Secondly, it will improve the ease of doing business and thirdly, it will improve the unemployment problem. We are not clear what prompted the hon.Minister and the Government to come out with this clause and say that it will improve employment position but actually it will deteriorate unemployment position. Cornell University of USA has done this study all across the globe. The study says that when the working hours, increase beyond 60 hours per week, it creates a huge work-family conflict. More number of working hours has led to consumption of tobacco, consumption of alcohol, obesity of men and depression in women. The same study has said that when the working hours go beyond 60 hours, there is reduction in the performance to the extent of 25 per cent. 45 per cent of the global deaths in the hazardous industries are happening in India. Are you going to look at the demands of the industry or also going to look at the welfare of the people and welfare of the State as a whole?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill will increase the overtime hours in factories. Several Acts are passed but they remain only in paper. In several factories extra work is done by the employees but they are not paid for the extra work. The decision of the government regarding the working hours for women employees is welcome. The government should make provision for PF, ESI etc facilities for daily wagers employed in factories. Interest of employees be taken care of putting in extra hours of work regarding their safety, salary and other aspects. There are several factories where employees work for long hours but they do not get their agreed salary. Such companies should be taken to task. SHRI MUTHAMSETTI SRINIVASA RAO (AVANTHI): Indian labour laws are intrinsically connected to our freedom struggle. The Factories (Amendment) Bill is seen as one of the landmark labour law reforms mooted by the Government which is keen to promote its Make in India campaign to boost domestic manufacturing. Manufacturing is crucial for both jobs and investment and it is hamstrung by the archaic Factories Act of 1948. The Government proposed 54 changes to the Factories Act, 1948, of which the major amendments are:- Provisions relating to imposing obligation upon the occupier to make a provision of personal protective equipment for workers exposed to various hazards; Providing canteen facilities in factories, providing for shelters or rest room and lunch rooms in respect of factories employing seventy five or more workers etc. I welcome these provisions because they are in the interests of the workers. The Andhra Pradesh Government, in April 2015, issued a Circular allowing women to work in factories in night shifts. I support this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Government targets the whole lot of labour laws. It is not for the benefit of the labourers, the workers, and the employees of our country, but for the benefit of corporate and for the benefit of big business houses of our country. In Section 64, it is said that the expression ‘fifty hours’ should be changed to ‘one hundred hours’. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it has been stated, “to facilitate ease of doing business so as to enhance employment opportunities”. Here, the two points are contradictory. In our country, we are seeing that in eight major employment generation sectors, only 1.30 lakh to 1.35 lakh people are being engaged yearly. But every year more than one crore unemployed youths are entering into the job market. So, if this Government really wants to give jobs to unemployed youths of our country, this overtime period should not have been increased. I find here that spread overtime is increased to 12 hours. Earlier, it was 10 hours and 30 minutes. Finally, I would like to say that majority of the productive workforce will be out of the coverage of the Factories Act. So, I strongly oppose the amendment and I want our hon.Labour Minister to look into this and request that this Bill be withdrawn.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I congratulate the hon.Minister for trying to implement as many labour laws as possible. A special order should be issued that along with the drinking water, cleanliness should also be taken care of. First Aid Box is missing in several factories. This aspect should be considered. Whenever there is a major case or accidents take place, as a special case, the Labour Courts may conduct the hearings of the cases in the premises itself. This will help the employees. Whenever there is a dispute, the Government should insist on tripartite consultations in all factories. Another point is, the inspection done by the labour inspectors could be made more transparent. With regard to pregnant women and disabled women not being able to enter into tankers and chambers, we appreciate the Government for including appropriate provisions in the Bill. As far as employing of women before 7.00 a.m. and after 6.00 p.m. in factories located in SEZ is concerned, it is good. But it should be done with proper security. We have a textile factory in Andhra Pradesh. This is run by the National Textiles Corporation. The Government should give proper guidance so that the machinery is updated and the working conditions improved. In the Bill, there are provisions regarding canteen, shelters, rest rooms and lunch rooms. So, wherever more than 20 workers are employed in a factory, providing of canteen, shelters, rest rooms and lunch rooms should be made mandatory. Yesterday, the hon.Minister was mentioning about providing help to the school run by the mica factory at Kalichedu. I would request him to consider extending help to this school and provide consolidated pay to the seven teachers who are there to help 150 students in the only school which is run by the Ministry of Labour in Kalichedu.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I rise to support this Bill. I welcome the amendment proposed for overtime in the Bill because no one ever gave it a thought ever since the year 1987. Several hon.Members citing the Bill introduced in the year 2014, termed it anti-labour. I do not find any anti-labour clause in the Bill. There is no provision in the Bill which makes overtime mandatory for any labourer. The time limit of fifty hours has been extended in the Bill and I do not think the labour force would have any problem with it. Most of the people are anxious because of growing unemployment in the country but I do not think overtime clause would create the problem of unemployment. It would not affect the unemployed persons. In a small state like Assam, there are approximately 25 lakh unemployed youth. The reasons for this unemployment rate should be looked into. I feel that the steps taken by the NDA Government to promote self employment and entrepreneurship under the Skill Development scheme and setting up a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and strengthening it financially by allocating Rs.12 thousand crore would help resolve the problem of unemployment to some extent. The condition of tea gardens in West Bengal and Assam since Independence should also be looked into. The working condition of labour force there is very bad. If the labour force would work overtime they will be paid for it. This aspect would be covered under Jan Dhan Yojana and Atal Pension Yojana. The maximum limit of pension has been made Rs.1000/-. I want that the Government should also do something about the remaining unorganised labour force.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You are saying that overtime limit is being increased but instead you are capping the limit. When will the terrorism of capitalism and corporate end. The people have elected you to eliminate such terrorism. I humbly request you that there should be agriculture based economy wherein 35 to 40 percent people would be engaged in agriculture and 20 percent people in agro-based village industry and 20 percent people would set up village industry for agriculture and remaining 20 percent people would be engaged in trade and service sector. The farmers co-operative, producers co-operative and consumer co-operative should give consideration to the welfare of labourers. You always divert every issue towards industrialists and industry which is not correct. One of the eminent economists has said that the problem of imbalance could be addressed by putting a check on export of ready products, checking large scale migration of labourers by promoting industrialization at local level, increasing employment opportunities at rural level and addressing the slum problems in rural areas. The industry which requires raw materials from basic industries should be set up in adjoining area in order to bring them under the control of concerned state governments. Local people should be provided employment on priority basis in these industries except the technical staff. The industries manufacturing fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, agriculture equipment etc. should be set up at village, block and district level under the co-operative societies. The local people should be provided employment on priority basis in these industries also. I urge that proper attention should be paid towards health and security of labourers. Lastly, I oppose the provision of overtime made for the labourers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to thank you for giving me time to speak on this important Bill. The attempt to make the hour of working from 8 to 50 to 100 hrs is against natural justice. My second request is that it will result in increase in unemployment because capital is meant for earning profit and if it can take more work from one person then it will not employ more person. It is a global phenomenon. Lakh-crores of youths are engaged in the unorganized sector, organized sector, manufacturing sector and service sector on a salary of Rs.15 thousand per month. In the outsourcing system, the contract system minimum wage is not being paid. They get such low salary that it becomes very difficult to lead a comfortable life. If something is to be done, it should be done for the unemployed youths, they should be paid reasonable wages. The labourer is forced to work more due to inflation and decline in real wages. He will throw himself in the work for his family. I request you to roll back this law and overtime which is being introduced.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Amendment Bill 2016 is being discussed. This Act was enforced in the year 1948 for the first time. Afterwards, amendments were brought about in 1949, 1950, 1951, 1954 & 1970. Last time the Amendment was made in the year 1987, however, under the present circumstances and with the advent of new technology as well as on the recommendations of the International Labour Organization and other Committees this proposal was introduced in the form of a Bill on 7th August 2014. Later on it was sent to the Standing Committee. Hon.Khargeji has also opposed it. I also want to tell the hon.Minister that only Sections 64 & 65 have been brought for amendment in case of making provision of overtime for increasing the working hours of the labourers. A little more time should have been given to the said Bill and after sending it to the Committee, it should have been discussed there. Labour organizations have also opposed it at several places. Therefore, I also oppose this Bill and simultaneously I want to give a piece of advice to withdraw this Bill and it should be sent to the Standing Committee. Such misinformation has been spread in the whole country that the industrialists are behind the introduction of this Bill. The leaders of Labour Unions have sent letters to us and tried to make several efforts to meet the Hon.Minister. Thus, there is a need for seeking suggestion from the Standing Committee after sending the said Bill to the Committee.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Factories Act was amended seven times during the last 70 years. There is a contradiction between the statement made in this Bill and the opinion of the Standing Committee. There are many provisions which are sought to be amended. The hon.Minister has chosen to amend only two Sections. That is Section 64 and 65. Without discussing other clauses amending the Sections in the original parent Act, how can we pass this Bill? The aim of the Government to introduce this Bill is to see the enhanced employment opportunities. I do not understand how by increasing the hours of overtime, they can increase the employment opportunities. Whereas the Standing Committee in its Report has stated that increasing the overtime hours across the factory would certainly have an adverse impact on employment generation. So, there is a contradiction between the opinion of the Standing Committee and the intention of this Bill. So, I would request the hon.Minister to withdraw this Bill and come with the Bill which is already introduced in this House which was referred to the Standing Committee. So, I would request the hon.Minister to withdraw this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today, we are present here to discuss the Factories Bill, 2016. On the one hand, the Prime Minister says that the Government will work towards providing employment to more and more young people. But here when we are discussing this Bill, we are talking about increasing the overtime. The Government wants to increase the employment hours of those working in the organized sector. The Government has talked about increasing 50 hours duration to 100 hours duration and has fixed the maximum period of overtime to 125 hours. There is no such provision in the entire Bill which indicates that the young person doing overtime will get an increase in the salary. The mention of giving overtime is related to organized sector only whereas 80% people in our country work in the unorganized sector. Factory Act applies to the factory engaging three hundred people. It means that the Government has not made any provision of overtime for the factories engaging less people than the figure of 300. It is mentioned in the Bill that there was a demand from the industries’ side. But we do not make any effort to bring any Bill taking into consideration the farmers’ demand. Railways never make any provision taking into consideration the daily travelers’ demand. The government in a hurry has just carried out the task of amending only Section 64 and 65 of the Factories Act, 1948. If the government goes on taking such steps, it will lead to discouraging Skill India programme, MUDRA scheme and other such schemes initiated by the Government. I oppose this Bill and would like to seek clarification from the Hon.Minister in this regard.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill is not a progressive one and rather it is a regressive one. The Government's intention is not to bring more workers under the ambit of the Factories Act but to remove them from the protection of the Factories Act. This Act really requires substantial amendments in this era because first, outsourcing is increasing in an alarming way; second, privatisation is taking place in a big way; and third, growth of unorganised sector is another big challenge. The priority in economic reforms is money first, market second, machinery third and man last. The trade unions throughout the country were demanding a comprehensive improvement in the Factories Act giving emphasis on health and safety. In economic reforms also due consideration has not been given to the interests of the working classes. The Government does not want the working class to raise its voice and it has not consulted the trade unions. This kind of ill- motivated and anti- labour actions will be fought and defeated by the working class in our country.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the last year, the Government of India gave thousands of crores rupees back to the labourers and the remaining amount was spent towards the welfare of the labourers. Through this Bill, it has been provided to enhance the overtime hours, allow the women to work during the night and provide security to them. It will give a fillip to the industries. If the laws which hamper the progress of the industries are replaced by a better law it will encourage the industries and generate employment opportunities.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ensuring adequate safety measures to the workers is the sole intention of the Factories Act of 1948. Unfortunately, the proposed amendment Bill is totally against the sole intention of the original Act. When a comprehensive Bill is pending for consideration of the House, what is the emergent necessity in bringing such an amendment to Sections 64 and 65? The power to frame rules is vested with the State Government. By this amendment arbitrary authority is being conferred upon the Government of India to frame rules. According to the original Act itself, it has very far-reaching consequences. The right of the State Government is being taken away by the Central Government, which is against federal character of our Constitution and anti-labour. I would like to know whether this is being done with the concurrence and the consent of the States. By allowing 125 hours of overtime in three months, Government is indirectly banning the recruitment in factories and creating unemployment problem in the country. So, my submission is to withdraw the Bill or refer this Bill also to the Standing Committee, which is already pursuing the recommendations.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Factories Act, 1948 has been enacted after the Independence and before the adoption of the Constitution. By this legislation, the safety, health and welfare of the workers of the factories have been taken care of. By this amendment, the State has extended its hands to the factories by appointing a welfare officer to ensure safety and welfare of the workers. But, we have been told that our nation is a welfare State. But if this amendment is passed by this House, we can no more say that this is a welfare State. Our nation should not be run by the corporates. But, our nation should be run for ensuring the welfare of the poor and the down-trodden workers. The Government is enhancing the overtime hours. It will impede employment opportunities and will affect the very health of the poor workers. So, I would request the hon.Minister to withdraw this amendment.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Government is effecting these two amendments on the demands of the industries. The Government should bring in the amendment Bill which was brought in the year 2016 for the benefit of forty Crore labourers during the next session of the Parliament. The Government has increased the number of overtime hours but no increase has been made in the rate of overtime. Several industries pay overtime on basic salary and dearness allowance thereon. I demand that the rate of overtime should be fixed on gross salary. Provisions to this effect should be there in this Bill.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Bill does not take into account the demands of Labour Unions. Why the Union Government is resorting to exempting clause in the name of uniformity? We don’t want the Government to dictate all the State Governments to compel the labourers to work overtime. Prime Minister had announced that two Crore people will get jobs every year, but data of their own department shows that much less jobs have been generated in the year 2015. Twenty thousand jobs have been lost. The Government must heed to the demands of labourers as well as industry.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I oppose the Bill. There is no medical compensation provided to contractual and casual workers in factories. The amendment should cover the loopholes of the law. The system of inspectors has failed and we need to replace it with a wider civil society concept. This is an anti labour Bill and an industry friendly Bill. Provision of safety for women working at night and canteen facility should be looked after in the factory which is the basic need of the workers. The Government needs to enlarge the concept of monitoring and inspection of the system. I recommend this Bill to be sent to the Standing Committee. A worker who wants to go the court, has to seek permission from the Government through Labour Commission which is a very lengthy process. Is the Labour Minister thinking anything about it? The workers' rights should not be infringed. THE MINISTER OF STATE OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR AND

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I thank all the hon.Members for participating in this discussion. I want to inform this August House that the proposal to increase over time period by amending Sections 64 and 65 is not at all mandatory, it is upto the worker to decide. There is no compulsion on him or her but it is an incentive to get the double wages. Another very important thing which I want to clarify to all the hon.Members is that we are not curtailing any powers of the State Governments. I already informed in the beginning that this is meant for facilitating increase in employment generation in the manufacturing sector. I have taken many safeguards about the overtime. When the comprehensive amendment comes, safety, working conditions, and all aspects will be taken up. There is no compromise on the working conditions or any welfare measures. All the issues will be addressed in the comprehensive amendment. About the urgency, I would like to mention that this is the need of the hour because we have taken up flagship programmes in which investments are coming and a large workforce is needed. About the role of the Central Government under this Act, I would like to tell that the federal structure is not at all damaged. Powers of the State Governments will not be curtailed. Worker's health and other things will be taken care of. In consultation with the State Government, the Central Government will frame all the required rules. This Bill pertains only to two sections. Shortly we will be coming up with a comprehensive Bill before the Parliament which will answer every query of the hon.Members. The Bill was passed.
