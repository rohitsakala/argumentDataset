 We are in agreement with GST. We have also agreed to the GST Council. But a problem has occurred now. A very pertinent question has arisen. The GST Council is fixing the rate of taxes. It is neither routed through the Parliament and the State Assemblies, nor is liable to judicial review. Around 60 per cent of goods and services are in the higher tax brackets under the GST regime. People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new regime under GST. Services to higher education institutes and utility bills will also be taxed higher. Prices of majority of essential drugs have increased up to 2.29 per cent. Prices of essential services have also increased. In essence, the tax rate of a large number of goods and services has increased under GST. I would also like the Minister of Finance to clarify today whether advocates and senior advocates have to pay GST or not? I am not against the GST and I have said so. I will request the hon.Finance Minister to kindly reconsider the fixation of rates made by the GST Council itself. This needs reconsideration because common people are affected due to this.

By providing safeguards to the special status to the State, the country has sent out a message to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that India cares for its sensitivity. The constitutional safeguards for the State as per Section 5 of the constitution of the State which empowers the State to levy tax-shall remain intact. After the roll out of the GST, textile sector in the country has been badly hit and needs to be exempted from the GST net. Otherwise, the textile sector will be uncompetitive. Items relating to disabled/handicapped persons should also be exempted from the GST. Unfortunately, the items of luxury are being prioritized instead of aids and appliances that are extremely essential for disabled persons in their routine life. There has to be a proper coordination between the Centre and States for effective implementation of GST. With these words, I support the Bill.
