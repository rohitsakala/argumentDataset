Indian Railway is the biggest employer in the world. Rail Budget 2016-17 will be remembered a historic Budget. Cleanliness and safety was a big challenge. By keeping both these subjects in priority list and constructing bio-toilets and bringing all the railway stations under surveillance by installing C.C.T.V. Cameras is a commendable step. Common people have been given relief by not increasing the passenger fare and freight charges. An important step has been taken by increasing unreserved, Deendayalu bogies in passenger trains. My Constituency Bharatpur is known for its bird sanctuary, tourists in large number come to see from the country and from foreign countries. Stoppage of Garib Rath, train no. 12910/12909 may be provided at Bharatpur Junction. The E.M.U. which runs between Delhi and Mathura may be extended up to Bharatpur Junction. A new rail line may be approved from Bharatpur Junction Rajasthan to Kosi Railway Station, (U.P.). I request that an overbridge may be constructed in my constituency Rupwas Town. DR. A. SAMPATH: Many of the proposals do not have necessary capital outlays. A promise was made in the 2010-2011 Union Railway Budget, to start a Railway Medical College, in Thiruvananthapuram. But in subsequent Budget no amount has been earmarked for this Railway Medical College. Coaching Yard at Nemom be started without any delay. Safe Journey is the right of a passenger. Refreshment stalls in Railway Stations are not properly maintained and Railway Station may please be handed over to Kudumba Shree Units run by Women's Self Help Groups. Foot Over-Bridges are to be provided at Nemom, Murukkumpuzha and Kaniyapuram Railway Stations. Thiruvananthapuram may be connected with Guwahati by a day train. Increase in Frequency of some trains should also be considered. Thousands of people are thronging Varkala every day. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to allow stops to all Express and Superfast Trains at Varkala Sivagiri Railway Station. Kadakkavur should be declared as a Heritage Railway Station as it is one century old. Staff and Pantry catering assistants who know and speak Malayalam should be appointed more in the Kerala bound trains. All the existing vacancies should be filled up at the earliest. DR. K. KAMARAJ: The Railway share in freight and passenger traffic has declined to 36% and 19% respectively in the year 2012. I welcome the following budget announcements namely Rail Auto Hub in Chennai, and North-South dedicated freight corridor from Delhi to Chennai. I welcome the step that the Railway Minister has not increased freight rates and passenger freight. It is laudable effort that Railway Minister concentrated his efforts in developing/ quadrupling railway lines and electrifications of tracks to reduce cost. It is surprising that no specific funds allocation were made for the several projects in Tamil Nadu. I request to Railway Minister to consult the Members of Parliament and the State Government during the formulation of National Railway Plan.

Indian Railway is the life line of the country. Last year a promise was made with regard to 100% FDI and PPP, but nothing concrete has been done in this regard. 64 per cent of rail revenue is received from freight but only 30 per cent of freight transportation is being undertaken by railways. Unmanned level crossings are threat to the life of people. There is need to increase the number of trains for the common people, in the place of bullet train. People have to travel in toilets in the general bogies. The difficulties of common man have been increased by increasing the advance reservation to 4 months because a common man can't plan his travel four months in advance. It is not feasible and it should be reduced to two months. The increasing number of accidents in Indian Railways is a matter of concern. In case of any accident group 'C' employee is made a scapegoat. Railways have appointed many Diploma and graduate engineers. Their social status is very low as compared to the engineers in other departments. Therefore, they are very much depressed. There are no promotional avenues for them.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The frequency of the DEMU train, which is running between Pratapnagar and Chhota Udaipur may be increased to four times. The toilets should be provided in all the trains. A second ticket window may be opened for the convenience of passengers. There is no parcel service between Baroda and Chhota Udaipur. Hence, goods bogies may be provided there. The work of Chhota Udaipur to Dhar Rail Line is progressing at snail's pace. It is necessary to compete Pratap Nagar, Chhota Udaipur, Alirajpur adn Dhar rail line as early as possible. Narrow gauge rail line from Pratap Nagar to Jambusar and from Jambusar to Samni may converted into broad gauge for the development of tribal areas. Chanond and Narbada Rivers are of immense religious importance. I demand to run old rail line as a heritage line. Provision should be made to lay a new rail line from Rajpipla to Kevadiya with a view to run the existing train upto Kevadiya which is running upto Rajpipla. The old narrow gauge railway station in my Constituency Champaner has been included in its world heritage. The old narrow gauge be converted into broad gauge.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This rail budget dedicated to common man disabled, senior citizens and women is definitely a welcome step. With a view to connect Jodhpur with South India, a weekly train is running between Jodhpur and Chennai for the last 15 years. It should be run daily. Bhagat Ki Kolhi is a railway station of international importance. If the gate on opposite side is opened, thousands of people will be saved from taking a round of about five kilometers. Immediate action needs to be taken to ensure a stoppage at Luni station for trains coming from the South. SHRI OM BIRLA: Train No. 05613, 05614 between Kota and Jhalawar were commissioned on temporary basis. It being an important route, these two trains should be made permanent. Similarly, Kota-Nizamuddin Holiday Special has been introduced on a temporary basis. There is a need for this train to be continued on a permanent basis. Kota-Ganganagar superfast train needs to be extended till Jhalawar. Kota-Udhalawar train needs to be extended till Baran. Kota to Jammu Tawi and Kota to Jdhampur are both running weekly, and this needs to be run daily. Jaipur to Pune runs twice a week. Both these trains need to be run on permanent basis. Haridwar-Valsad which runs through Kota, should be run on daily basis. Jaipur-Mysore runs twice weekly and needs to be run regularly. A new train should operate between Kota to Udaipur and extended till Ahmedabad. A new train needs to be introduced connecting the Kota-Gwalior route to Gorakhpur, Allahabad and Varanasi. Golden Temple, Jaipur-Mumbai superfast should have a halt at Dakniya Talav. The Janshatabdi Express between Kota to Delhi should start from Dakniya Talav. Ajmer-Jabalpur express should have a halt at Indragadh, Bundi district. Taleda in Bundi district should be included as one of the halts for Dehradun Express. Now, I would like to highlight the need for new rail line and projects to be undertaken such as Jhalawar-Baran -Sheopur Railway Project; Mandalgadh-Shahpura-Kokdi; Jhalawad-Aagar-Ujjain; Jhalawar-Chabda; Jhalawar-Bhopal; Ramganj Mandi-Nemach-Bari Sadri; and Bhawani Mandi- Mandsaur-Pratapgad-Banswada.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the time of meter gauge line, a train from Bhilwara to Hyderabad was there but new train is available to Hyderabad only three days a week. It should run on daily basis. Jaipur- Yashwantpur train should have a stoppage at Bhilwara. Trains from Bhilwara to Mumbai is available for three days a week. A daily train for Mumbai should be introduced. From Udaipur to New Jalpaigudi one train in a week is available and there is need to increase its frequency. Marusagar Express between Ajmer to Ernakulam should be extended up to Udaipur or Chittogarh. Bikaner to Chennai and Jaipur to Madras trains run once a week on Sunday only. Anubrat Express No. 22632 to Chennai should be diverted from Phulera Junction to Ajmer, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Ratlam.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I hope that the government would complete the work of dedicated Delhi-Mumbai Freight Corridor on priority basis. A Logistic Park may be set up at Ringus or near Ringus. This park will facilitate the transportation of goods from Jhunjhunu, Churu-Bikaner, Srigangana etc. to Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Delhi etc. I would request to the Railway Minister to complete the electrification works of Ringus via Sikar-Bikaner, Srigangana rail line. A train from Sikar to Delhi may be started immediately at night. In addition to that Sikar Express which runs two days a week should run on daily basis. Janshatabdi Express from Ajmer to Nizamuddin which runs two days a week may be started on daily basis except Thursday. A direct train from Bikaner to Sikar may be introduced. Chandigarh to Bandra via Neem ka Thana Ringus Express should be run on daily basis. It will be much beneficial to the people of two passenger trains from Sikar to Lokaru are introduced during day time.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I congratulate the minister for his pace in completing the ongoing projects which are pending since ages. The sanction of glass coaches for Araku has been a pending demand for the past 2 decades. I am grateful for the Hon'ble Minister for making this dream come true and sanctioning the coaches and for his initiative in modernization of the railway stations which is a step ahead in transforming the railways into passenger friendly means of transport. A railway zone with Visakhapatnam as the headquarters may be considered positively for which the people of Andhra Pradesh will remain grateful. I greatly appreciate the government's development philosophy with high priority of passengers. I appreciate the steps taken by the government during last 12 months and successful completion of last budget commitments. I appreciate the safety steps initiated towards the security of passengers. The commitment towards the women safety is also greatly commendable. It is the need of the hour to provide hygienic conditions in the railways. I sincerely thank you, for the customer centric amenities. I would like to congratulate the Hon'ble Minister of Railway for his great initiative in reforming and reviving the Indian railways into a customer friendly railways.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is completely a common man's Budget. All the steps taken in this Budget will benefit the common men and will improve the infrastructure of the railways. The Railway Minister has given assurance to improve the railway security, safety and the amenities for travelling public. It has also gone ahead in the direction of curtailing its expenditure. Hence, it is a hopeful budget. However, the burden of expenditure on account of the Seventh Pay Commission will affect to a great extent the profits of railways for the year 2016- 17. Bikaner-Delhi railway line was constructed a hundred years back when there were no demand for manned or unmanned level crossings. Churu lacks these level crossings. These should be provided on this section. There are many such villages on Loharu-Ratangarh. Sadulpur-Hanumangarh, Sadulpur-Jhumpa, Ratangarh- Sardarshehr, Ratangarh-Degane Section where there is no link between the villages and with their agriculture fields. Railway under bridges should be provided here. Since State Governments do not have sufficient funds for the same, the railways should construct them on their own. Survey for rail line in respect of Sardarshehr- Hanumangarh, Sikar-Salaser-Bidasar-Nokha had been completed. Hence, the work of laying this railway line should be sanctioned. Train No. 14705/14706 should be regularized and extended up to Haridwar. Weekly trains should be run on three days a week. Survey should be conducted for the new railway line between Hisar and Bhadra. It has great strategic significance. Full amount of sanctioned allocation should be released for the over-bridge at 142 in the eastern side of Sadulpur Junction.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is for the first time that this rail Budget does not focus on a single state but the entire country has been given attention. Only announcements have not been made in it but it gives a clear direction to the implementation and entire working style of the Railways. In this budget special attention has been given on the safety and basic amenities for the passengers. The most important feature of this budget is that it has not hiked passenger fare and freight but taken full care of the passenger facilities and no compromise has been made with the modernization of the railways. Now it has moved in the direction of becoming a world class system. In this budget a number of steps have been taken for quality improvements and also for the unreserved category of passengers. Announcement has been made for survey in respect of a railway line between Jalore, Sirohi and Udaypur. It should be completed at the earliest and this should be connected with the rail network. Announcement had also been made to develop Abu Road Railway Station as a Model Railway Station . But the work has not been initiated. Moreover, Jalor, Bhimal and Madaran stations should also be included in this list. A pantry car should be provided on Chennai-Jodhpur express up and down. Train No. 16125/16126. Its frequency should also be increased. The frequency of superfast train no. 12489/12490 should also be increased and it should be regulated. It will increase the revenue earnings of the Railways and will provide relief for the passengers in waiting list. The train No. 22478 may be extended up to Raniwada. It will add the revenue to railway and will make the journey up to Jaipur convenient for the passengers of this region. About 7 lakh people of my constituency Jalore-Sirohi live in different cities of the South India. They have no direct train service to their native place from their work place. A direct train link from their place will raise the railway earnings and will give relief to that section of people. Direct rail link should be provided between Jalor and Palampur. Rounds of the Express No. 14805/14806 should be increased and even general bogies should be provided on this train. In view of the problems of passengers and villagers important trains like Ashram Express, Garibrath Express should be given stoppage at Sirohi Road Railway Station. DMU No. 79437/79438, 79431/79432 should be extended up to Falna. It will make the journey up to Palampur, Mehgame and Ahmedabad convenient for the farmers, traders and rural population . It will also increase the revenue earnings of the railways. Bikaner- Bandra-Bikaner Train should be given stoppage at Swarupganj station. Intercity Train No. 19411/19412 Ashram Express and Haridwar Mail should also be provided stoppage at Swaroopganj station to make it convenient for the local passengers. Name of Sirohi Road Station should be changed to Pindwara Railway Station as it falls in that revenue Tehsil. It will remove the confusion among the travelling public. SHRI KANTILAL BHURIA: The Budget presented by Hon'ble Railway Minister is very disappointing and no relief has been given to the people of any section . I would like to request that my following demands in relation to my Parliamentary Constituency Ratlam-Jhabua may be looked into. Dahod-Indore New Railway Line should be completed on priority basis; Priority should be given to Dhar-Chhota Udaipur new railway line; As per rule the farmers of Madhya Pradesh should be given compensation four times of the cost of land for acquisition of their land; No solid action has been taken to make Ratlam as model station in spite of declaration for this effect; Delay in action of land acquisition for Ratlam- Banswara-Dungarpur Line. SHRI CHANDULAL SAHU: I support this Rail Budget. Hon'ble Railway Minister has announced several schemes to revamp the Railways and work has also been started on man schemes. I would like to thank and request the Railway Minister that in my State Chhattisgarh there are many regions which are full of cultural diversity and natural beauty and they can be developed as tourist centers. These regions should also be connected with railway networks. Chhattisgarh Express should be named as 'Shahid Veer Narayan Singh Express'. Bagbahara Railway station of my Lok Sabha Constituency should be provided with stoppage of Puri-Surat Express, Durg-Jagdalpur, Pur-Gandhidham-Puri-Shirdi Express, Vishakapatnam-LTT etc. Rayaham Express should be operated on daily basis. SHRI RAVINDER KUSHAWAHA: Hon'ble Railway Minister in his budget proposals has taken a commendable step to introduce travelling entrance . I demand that hon'ble Railway Minister should make the efforts to establish Insurance Company on behalf of Indian Railways. Arrangement should be made to opt insurance during reservation of tickets. The proposal of install more escalators and lifts in view of old person's convenience is also a welcome step. To provide full right to half of the population of the country has also been considered in the rail budget. It is proposed to provide 33% reservation for women in catering unit contracts. To meet the shortage of drinking water open tender should be invited from Branded companies and maximum retail price should be fixed Rs.10/- per bottle as each water bottle costs only Rs.5. It has been mentioned to revive catering policy with regard to stalls of miscellaneous items. I would like to request hon'ble Railway Minister that while making new policy the interests of small license holders of miscellaneous items particularly interest of reserved sections should be protected.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The present Rail Budget is a path-breaking budget. In this budget more emphasis is laid for making railways more people centric, more accountable to passengers, instead of using it as a political tool. Antyodaya Express Train, Deendayal unreserved coaches, Hamsafar, and Tejas trains will benefit all. A train, named Astha Shakti will be run to exploit the potential of religious tourism. I feel very happy that the hon.Minister has announced to link Hazira Port with railway line as well as to construct new bridges and 36 subway bridges in Gujarat. The announcement for upgrading Railway National Academic located in Baroda as University will immensely benefit the tribals of the area.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a very balanced budget, taking care of all sections of the society. A number of targets fixed in mission 2020 will not only render train journey more comfortable but the safety of passengers will also be ensured. I am confident that the Indian Railways will be able to achieve the target fixed for broad gauge conversion by the year 2020. I am very thankful to the Hon'ble Minister for approving the demand of fourth line from Jalgaon-Bhusawal and third line from Bhusawal to Manmad. Chalisagaon dhulia rail electrification has also been approved. There is an urgent need to construct FOBs at various places like in Kajgaon-Bhadgaon at level crossing number 126 and 149, Milk Fedration Jalgaon at crossing No. 148. Shivaji Nagar, Asoda , Jalod and Amalaner. I request the Hon'ble Minister that these FoBs should be constructed with railways own funds as the state government is facing financial stress due to draught since many years in a row and unable to give its share for construction. The work for upgrading Jalgaon, Dharangaon, Chalisagaon, Pachora and Amalaner station as model station should be expedited. The stoppages of various trains should be provided at Nagar Devala, Mahsavad, Pachora, Chalisgaon and Jalgaon which are passing through these stations. The trains namely Bhusawal-Dhule passenger train and Bhuswal-Mumbai express train were started but these trains are now discontinued. I humbly request you to restart these trains. I on behalf of the people of Jalgaon thank the Hon'ble Minister that he took the notice of the difficulty being faced by the people and sanctioned Rs.50 thousands crore to construct foot over bridge at railway crossing number 147.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Every ambitious plan requires a vision and a mission. The Hon'ble Minister has taken the initiative by establishing better co-ordination in these two elements in the direction for fulfilling the dream of prospering nation building. The efficient financial management of the last year resulted in record high saving of Rs.8720 crore. The railways has estimated to earn revenue of Rs.1,84,820 crore which is 10.1% more than that of the last year. The capital budget for the year 2016-17 is Rs.1.21 lakh crore which is a big achievement in itself. I request the Hon'ble Minister to start work on Karan Prayag rail line, Rishikesh-Doibala rail line, Devband to Roorki via Jhabreda railway line ; to expedite the work on Tanakpur-Bageshwar rail route; to upgrade Dehradun, Haridwar, Nazimbad and Kotdwar station and to provide halt of Lahori express at Athel Buzurg station to fulfill the long pending demand of Sikhs. Haridwar is the spiritual capital of the world. It should be connected by high speed trains to all metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Jaipur Kolkata and Mangluru. All the Haridwar bound trains should be destined to Rishikesh via Raywada in order to improve the worsening traffic condition.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Speedy steps may be taken to complete the further electrification from Kozhikkode to Mangalore. During the last interim Railway Budget Badagara station was selected for setting up of cold-storage facilities for preserving vegetables, fruits etc. But construction works for the same has not been started yet. Tellichery, Badagara, Mahe Quilandy have been declared as 'Aadarsh' Railway Stations. It is unfortunate that this station is in a most dilapidated condition and the proposed reconstruction of this station may be competed at the earliest. I have allotted an amount of Rs.50 Lakhs from MPLADS for the construction of underpass at Onchiyam but is yet to be completed. Time and again I have raised the issue of the minor but important stations like Nadanpuram Road, Jagnath Temple Gate, Iringal and Chemanchery which need extension. It is painful that no action has been taken to raise or extend these platforms for the safety and convenience of the commuters at these stations. There is great demand for an underpass between Moorad Bridge and the Palayad Junction at Vatakara.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The pending projects pertaining to our Madurai Constituency have not been considered at all. Madurai has a railway junction that has direct link with all the parts of the country. It is a tourism hub attracting thousands of people every day from all over the world. Unfortunately, I do not find allocation of adequate funds for both the ongoing and the new project which are important for the economic and overall development of Madurai City and the surrounding districts. I urge upon the Ministry of Railways to expedite the completion of all pending projects in Tamil Nadu in a time bound manner. Our Government of Tamil Nadu ably guided by our revered leader, Puratchi Thalaivi, Amma, had taken up with the Centre already that compete doubling of Chennai- Kanyakumari must be given top priority. Our persistent demand for Chennai- Thoothukudi freight corridor is also pending with the railways. I would like to stress upon the need to link Madurai with Karaikudi via Melur and I urge upon the railways to take up this new railway line project at the earliest to bring out a socio- economic change in that area. An additional train between Madurai and Bangaluru may be introduced with a first AC Coach. Here, I would also like to point out that the three decade long pending project between Madurai-Bodinayakanur is to be considered for implementation on war-footing speed.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This budget is praiseworthy, foresighted, progressive and practical which will help in nation building. I would like to draw the attention of the Hon'ble Minister towards problem of my Constituency. Purushottam express between Delhi to Puri be extended up to Jaipur. A new train between Shirdi to Jaipur be introduced. Ajmer-Jammu-Tawi Puja express be extended up to Katra. An AC 3 tier coach and a sleeper coach be attached to the passenger train running between Jodhpur Barmer during night. A shuttle train between Jaipur and Sawai Madhopur be introduced. Delhi-Jaipur Ahmedabad rail route should be included in high speed up-gradation scheme. Sangner and Dhanakya stations (satellite stations) be developed into rail terminals for decongesting the Jaipur station.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am happy that action is initiated on 149 budget announcements of 2015-16. We expect justice for states like AP which have received raw deal in several budgets. The proposal to sanction a railways line from Rayalaseema to Amravati was not considered in this budget. Kindly consider the request to have a new railway line between Kurnool and the Holy City Mantralayam at the earliest. The railway Zone promised at Visakhapatnam has so far not seen the light of the day. Any attempt to improve the profitability of the railways at the cost of the social obligation and without keeping in mind poor man's affordability will become counterproductive.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the very prudent and practical budget which encompasses all the challenges before railways like safety and security, punctuality, cleanliness, honesty and transparency in railway projects. The initiative for permitting 100% FDI for developing infrastructure has been started. I request the government to resolve the problems being faced by various categories of employees immediately. I have submitted a memorandum to the hon.Minister received from loco-pilots associations. The demands mentioned in the memorandum should be considered sympathetically. The junior or senior section engineers of railways are demanding Grad-B scale for themselves since a very long time. This demand should also be considered sympathetically. I am very thankful that a number of long pending demands of Gorakhpur find mention in this budget. I request the Hon'ble Minister to introduce a Tejas train from Gorakhpur to New Delhi, a Hamsafar train from Gorakhpur to Kolkata and a Uday train from Gorakhpur to Allahabad, to regularize Dehradun Express running between Gorakhpur and Haridwar, for upgrading platforms and construction of over bridges on level crossings at Pipraich, Pipiganj, Sahajnwan, Somingarh, and Campierganj railway stations. The construction of over-bridge at Surajkund and Sahajanwa in Gorakhpur District is going on. The work should be completed at the earliest. The roads on the railways' land at most of the level crossings of the NE railways are in very bad conditions. These should be re-constructed on priority basis. The pathetic condition of Railway hospital should be improved by providing better amenities. The road sides adjacent to Gorakhpur station have been encroached upon by street vendors. This encroachment should be removed and vendors may be rehabilitated. This will not only improve the income the railways, but also helps to keep station clean.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to lay the proposals for new railways lines in the Kannur district. A fourth platform in the eastern side may be constructed urgently. Necessary approvals may be accorded and sufficient provisions may be provided for development of rail infrastructure for connecting proposed Kannur Airport with existing rail infrastructure, to conduct survey of Valapattanam-Azhilkkal Port byline, Thalassery-Mysore line. A Pit lane may be constructed at Kannur station. Urgent steps may be taken to construct Aprons in all the three existing lines of Kannur Railway station.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The hon.Minister has disappointed us and the people of the country for second time. There have been no new ideas, whether big or small in the Minister's speech. The speech seems to be in line with the grand tradition of using big words and slogans, for which this Government is infamous. Perfect at rephrasing, the same services are renamed-Tejas instead of Rajdhani, Hamsafar instead of Garib Rath, Antyoday instead of Janta Express. 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas' does not reflect in this year's rail budget. I am not against development but for a uniform overall growth and development in the country, especially the backward. The important point is, if Railway growth has come down. If Railways don't grow, then the country's economy cannot grow. The MoU between Indian Railways and Life Insurance Corporation to raise Rs.1.5 lakh crore over the next five years was actually signed in March 2015. In October 2015, LIC subscribed about Rs.2,000 crore only. This is far less than the required average of 30,000 crore per year to fulfill the deal over the five years. There is not a definite roadmap for restructuring of the railway board. The Minister has declared that Joint Ventures with State Governments should be the means to fund new rail projects. It is a huge burden on State Governments. Railway Minister has announced that there is no fare hike. Fact remains that Modi Government hiked passenger fare by 18.55% over last 20 months. It is also unfortunate that all new coaches are diverted to favorite regions in north India and junked coaches are put into service in southern states. My home state of Karnataka and the constituency of Gulbarga which suffer from pendency of a huge number of vital railway works and projects. Construction of Road Over-bridges near Mother Terasa School in Gulbarga. The UPA Government sanctioned 3 railway divisions namely, Jammu, Assam and Gulbarga. Expedite the completion of this work in the interest of the backward region of Hyderabad Karnataka. Gulbarga Division is divided in three zones and for various issues one has to approach different offices this problem of running around can be resolved and work can be completed in time. Construction of Railway Bogie factory at Kadechur, Yadgir district. Construction of Pit lines at Gulbarga. Another pit line was sanctioned on Gulbarga-Bidar new railway line. This work still has not yet started. Construction of Gulbarga-Bidar new railway line. The yellanka Railway Station requires overall development as a 'Model station'. Meagre amount has been provided for the doubling work from Yellanka to Penukonda. Further, more allocation of funds to this project is extremely essential. Railway Terminus at Bengaluru. Hassan-Bengaluru new Railway line. It requires in the interest of the public.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Following are some demands for the Railway Ministry to be considered. New Rajdhani Express is also necessary for connection to Delhi; Nashik is known as religious city, there is a demand for Nashik-Ajmer and Nashik Tirupati trains ; Bhusawal to Igatpuri local train is also necessary; it is necessary for extension of local train from Kasara up to Igatpuri; and provisions should be made for survey of Nashik-Surat or Nashik-Vapi new railway line.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I want to place following demands to Railway Minister : Need to start new trains from Sewa Gram station to Mumbai and Pune after the name of father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and Acharya Vinova Bhave. Provision of toilets, potable water and sanitation at Wardha, Chandur, Dhamangaon, Vasud, Morshi, Banoda railway stations. Construction of full shades at Wardha, Sewagram, Hiuganghat, Chander railway stations. Construction of foot overbridge at Wardha station. Construction of ramp for the use of senior citizens handicapped and patients at Sewagram, Hiugaughat Dhaman gaon railway stations. Construction of road over-bridge at Hiugaughat Railway Station. Provision of light at platform and exit gate at Chaudur Railway Station. Provision of Police port at Dhamangaon railway station. Availability of wagons at Varud and Moshi railway Station. Need of conversion of Pulgoan Arvi Amla narrow gauge into broad gauge.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Railway loading points like Naya Garh, Jaroli, Banspani, Deogarh, Badbal, Bolami mines in my Parliamentary Constituency are famous for high income points. These lines will be fruitful economically if these lines are linked with various lines of the country. Rupsa Bangripari railway line under SER should be linked with Deoghar or Banspani of Keonjhar district via Champua, Tata Nagar-Badam Pahar railway line should be extended upto Keonjhar. By doing so two important steel cities could be linked easily by connecting Tata Nagar and Kalinga of Tajpur, Odhisha. Tata Nagar- Amritsar superfast train should be extended from Tata Nagar to Jajpur via Barbil Keonjhar. The train running from Visakhapattanam to Tata Nagar via Barbil should be extended up to New Delhi so that the people of three tribal areas Keonjhar, Mayurbhannj, Chaibasa Paschammi Singhbhoom can avail travelling facility to and from journey to Delhi.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A number of passengers go to Hardwar from Bikanner by Bikanner-Haridwar train, but this only train is not sufficient to cope with heavy traffic rush. Therefore, if any 'Hamsafar' train is announced for Bikanner-Haridwar, it will be convenient. The Minister of Railways has been already requested to lay new Anoopgarh-Bikanner line. If this project is included in the railway budget, it will fulfill the demand of the people of that area and the army. It will also strengthen infrastructure of Indian Railways in view of strategic importance of the army.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the outset I congratulate Hon'ble Railway Minister for giving a very forward looking and constructive budget. Manglore need to be carved out as new division for the better and well coordinated administration of the zone. A Railway University to be established at Dharwad. It is suggested to lay a separate track adjacent to EMD line for handling over the prepared coaches and to construct additional pit line adjacent to the present pit line with a capacity of 04 coaches with Crane facility. Hubli-Dharwad twin cities in northern part of Karnataka is the main link between the industrial and trade corridor of Mumbai at one end and Bangalore-Chennai at the southern end. Presently there are limited number of trains. There has been a long standing demand for new trains. Bangalore-Varansi New Train via Tumkur Hubli Belgaum and a new train from Hubli to Jodhpur to be introduced. There is also a need to introduce emergency quota from Hubli towards Yeshvantpur. There are complaints from many source that the inspection coaches are attached to main/ exp trains carrying the families and friends of officers for enjoyment sake. Thus, instead of attaching inspection coaches the officers can travel in 1st class or 2nd class AC to inspect and to ascertain the actual problem of railways. Only head of zonal Railways i.e. only General Manager should hold one inspection carriage.

I represent Kandhamal Parliamentary Constituency of Odisha, this is one of the most backward and tribal dominated district of the state in spite of being very rich in natural resources. It is sad that 7 districts of Odisha have not witnessed railway since Independence, include Kandhamal. Khurda-Bolangir, under construction of course, will pass through my constituency touching Nayagarh, Daspalla and Boudh. The state government, Shri Naveen Pattnaik has fulfilled his promise.

The Railway Budget in general, should take into account the following factors in my constituency, Jajpur, Odisha. Most of the Railway stations have not seen any progress in the last 7 decades. Basic amenities are missing. I would like to draw your kind attention towards the development of Railways in my region/constituency i.e. Dist. Jajpur, Odisha which has been neglected by subsequent governments after the Independence of India. The stations of the area have almost remained at the same level where it was when India attained Independence in 1947 while the rest of the country has seen tremendous infrastructural development in the Railways. In this connection, the Haridaspur Railway Station, an Old Railway Station established during the British days, can perform a vital role to serve the goal set by the Nation besides contributing to revenue of Indian Railways. For kind information of the hon.Minister, the ongoing railway line from Haridaspur to Paradeep port will be a significant advancement in the coming couple of years, so it needs improvement of carrying capacity of the station. Besides this the Railway Stations in the Jajpur district i.e. Dhanamandal, Bairi, Jenapur, Baitarani Road, Korai, Jakhapura and J.J.K.R. Road need urgent attention and due care for their development. Further, there is no Railway connectivity to Jajpur town, the district headquarters of Jajpur which was the historical capital of Odisha and its world famous shrine i.e. Biraja Temple. It is pertinent to note that the JAJPUR district provides huge revenue to the railway form the freight of the mineral ores and finished steel products from its steel plants. But tragically Jajpur district has not been given its rightful dues by the Railways and continues to be neglected over the years since Independence. Over to take needful action for a technical study for extending rail connectivity to Dharma port which is owned by Group via Jajpur Town and take appropriate steps for sanctioning funds to ensure improvement of the above mentioned Railway Stations in conformity to the set of goals of Government of India.

I am very thankful for announcing Aastha circuit trains . I would like to place my demand to expedite the process for this facilitation provision of passenger amenities and upgradation of the station at the earliest. Aligning my demands with the Government's agenda of 1,600 km of electrification this year and 2,000 km proposed for the next year, I would request electrification of Rajkot to Okha rail route of my constituency. The induction of Shatabdi Express between Ahmedabad and Dwarka is a longstanding demand. If Shatabdi Express is introduced, the journey period can be reduced to half. Due to the strategic location of Jamnagar city, Indian Army, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy have units/establishments in Jamnagar. A high speed train line with Ahmedabad would provide a major respite to the men in uniform.

I am thankful to you for allowing to me to participate in the discussion on Railway Budget 2016-17. I would like to request for considering the new line between Almatti and Koppal, which can drastically reduced the distance between Vijayapura and Bengaluru. The unmanned Railway Crossings should also get a lift in my constituency, Bellary so that rail and road traffic can be smoothened besides averting any mishap. The Railways should think of constructing over bridges or under bridges to avert such inconveniences to the people of Bellary. I also request the Railway Minister to provide a time line to the sanctioned new lines-Nanjangud-Nilambur (236 km), Mysuru-Kushalnagar (85 km), Talaguppa-Honnavar (82 km), and Dharwad-Belagavi (91 km)- to be executed under the extra-budgetary resources funding. I humbly request him to consider my proposals.

Taking the conditions of the passengers into consideration, the government has given priority to complete the old pending projects. Provision has been made to provide security for passengers and provide separate toilets in every train for the Divyangs (the disable). The railways have also taken initiative to provide Wi-Fi facility in selected 400 railway stations. A separate Deen Dayal Unreserved Coach has been provided in every train. Given the importance of Ahmed Nagar Station I would like to put forth some of my demands for the development of the local area; to provide halt for all weekly trains crossing Ahmed Nagar Station on Daund Manmad Line, on Shirdi-Mumbai, Shirdi-Pandalpur, Pune-Jammu trains at Rahuri and Belwandi stations, provide pantry car facility in weekly express Kolhapur- Nizamuddin train No. 12147/12148, provide AC coach facility in Kolhapur- Gondia Maharashtra Express Train. In a meeting of the Member of Parliament with General Manager of Central Railways and the Manager of Solapur Division all the above mentioned demands have been intimated. For the sake of convenient of the common people the government is requested to consider the aforesaid demands. THE MINISTER OF RAILWAYS (SHRI SURESH PRABHU) replying said: The Budget for 2016-17 was made in very challenging times. It was the toughest year. Shortfall in loading was on account of less imported coal, cement, iron ore, depressed steel demand, decentralized procurement of foodgrains and global slow-down which have impacted the loading containers by almost 8.80 million tonnes. Railways have also tried to add new sources of revenue and also targeted reduction in the cost of operation. This year the Plan Budget is Rs.1,21,000 crore. It is 21 per cent higher than the expected Plan for the previous year. In 2016-17, Railways will be commissioning 2,800 Kilometres of broad gauge line. In railway electrification, 1,600 kilometres is to be commissioned in 2015-16. Railways are also starting Roll-on Roll-off pilot time table freight trains multi- point loading. Railways are also giving a big push for expanding containerization. New trains services like Tejas and Hamsafar which will be covering costs completely. Railways will not be losing money. We will also add capacity for unreserved and reserved travel where the same number of passengers will yield higher revenues. The non-fare revenues is something which Railways will have to pay a lot of thrust. The new strategy is revamping the parcel business; advertising will be increased at least four times. Monetizing data and software is something which for the very first time are Railways trying to do; not only in India, probably anywhere. All of this in turn will ensure the long-term financial viability of the Railways. Scrap disposal will be at least 50 per cent more. This year, Rs.1,500 crore are being saved on account of cost optimisation of operation. On electricity, an annualised saving of Rs.3,000 crore is to be achieved by the end of this year. For every rupee we spend on the Railways we have a five times better impact on the economy as a whole. Railways decided that it would not only be relying on the capital expenditure coming from the Main Budget but we would also do on our own. For Assam and the North-East, in 2013-14, the allocation was Rs.2,330 crore; last year, for 2015-16, it was, Rs.5,368 crore this year again, it is Rs.5,340 crore. In the case of Bihar, the 2013-14 allocation was Rs.1,244.8 crore; this year, it is increased again to Rs.3,171 crore. In Karnataka for 2013-14, the allocation was Rs.909.4 crore; it was increased to Rs.2,779 crore this year etc. During 2008- 2014, 658 ROB/RUB/subways were constructed as against an average of 1037 during the years 2014-16. In 2016-17 the speed of gauge conversion was 7 kms. per day as against an average of 4.3 kms. A day in the last six years. We delegated powers to General Managers which has resulted into faster decision making. There is e-Sameeksha, a weekly monitoring. I am very happy to say that our debt is hardly anything. Railways have achieved and operating ratio of 90 per cent. Our next year's target is 92 per cent. Accumulated arrears of track renewal has come down from 7588 kilometres to 5300 kilometres. The number of over age wagons has come down from 14649 to 6177. Common man is the centre of this Budget. Railways have started Antyodaya Express. We have started 2-4 new Deen Dayal coaches etc. in 2008, 8146 ST/SC backlog vacancies were to be filled up. Now we have brought down the backlog and now 99.55 per cent vacancies have been filled up. I am very happy to say that we are talking about even stalls were the SC/ST will be properly taken care of. The new rolling stock which can run at 200 kilometres an hour is being produced and would be available soon. Now we are starting Tajas which will show case the future of train travel in India operating at speeds of 130 kilometres and above. The Cabinet has approved for 400 stations development. Many hon.Members have raised the question about Bullet Trains. It is the previous Government that decided on this route and not us. We are now trying to make new State JVs. This will open a new avenue for development we are trying to set up a holding company for the Railway PSUs. We are also focusing on transparency in a big way. Social media is being used. I am definitely saying that the Railways has improved in the last about two years a little more than what it was. The discussion was concluded. All the Demands for Grants on Account (Railways) were voted in full. All the Supplementary Demands for Grants (Railways) voted in full. THE APPROPRIATION (RAILWAYS) VOTE ON ACCOUNT BILL, 2016 The Bill was passed THE APPROPRIATION (RAILWAYS) BILL, 2016 The Bill was passed
