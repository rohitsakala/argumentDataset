The terrorist attack at Pathankot was not only a terrorist attack but was a conspiracy to undermine the strength of the armed forced of our country. They wanted to prove as to how the Armed Forces which is unable to protect itself, will protect the country. This terrorist attack has a larger ramification. Nowhere in the world, in terrorist attacks, do we have so much collateral damages from our security forces as we have seen in India. Have we learnt our lesions from past incidents? That is what we have to ask ourselves. Did we have enough warning on these incidents? Did we act correctly? Did we act as per an established protocol to address counter-terrorism issues or do we act on the whims and fancies of the Government in power? The NSG was called in but was the NSG the correct choice? What were the reasons for calling the NSG despite having 50,000 armed forces stationed in Pathankot? I call it a critical mistake with authority? It took them 48 hours to locate the terrorists and have the encounter. Whereas in Paris when the terrorists attack happened, it took two hours for them to find the terrorists, to kill them and finish the encounter. My first question to the hon.Home Minister is whether a meeting of the Crisis Management Group was convened to address this issue. Had the meeting of that Group been convened, the conflicting statements would not have gone out from the Government. It is a matter of establishing protocols, establishing procedure while we in the future, can fight against terror. The capabilities of our intelligence agencies are not for collecting information from newspaper reports or from websites as has been proved in the past. Their capacity is judged by synthesizing that information into collectible, actionable intelligence, which can be acted upon. We will keep waiting for the Governments to change in order to fulfill their requirements. Are we serious on our fight against terror? In this incident if the Army had been deployed, the situation would have been different. The Army is used to these mechanisations of the terrorists. They are used to the fact that these kinds of tricks are involved. The NSG, even though it was being headed by an Army in operation, ultimately lies under the police. They are not for counter terrorism. There is a confusion about the manner in which decisions were being taken. So, I would like a categorical answer from the Home Minister that in this particular encounter or for that matter, in encounters in the future, who is the person we must turn to, for accountability and decision making? Is there an established protocol under which these decisions are taken? Or, is it left again to the Government in power to decide? This particular incident brings to light many deficiencies in our system. It also raises question if we are bringing enough pressure on Pakistan to arrest terrorists. It is time this entire House wakes up to reality. It is time we as a Government put our resources with the fight against terror. We shore up our intelligence agencies because we know there is a huge deficiency there. We ensure that a strict protocol is maintained, a procedure is defined and announced which is enacted in the US but remains just a procedure here in India whereby we can actually ascertain and deal with such terrorists encounters.

I am grateful to the hon.Member for raising an issue of national importance. However, during his speech he has raised some issues and the first issue raised by him is that what exactly is the state of coordination in our country when such a situation arises. We talk about cooperative federalism in our country. I endorse this view that intelligence failure do occur. However I would like to say that we need to ponder over the fact as to who is responsible for giving a blow to the morality of the concept of cooperative federalism which results in intelligence failures. The second question is that whose responsibility law and order is? We consider law and order as a state subject. On the other hand whenever article 355 is invoked states do come with a grievance that the Center is making inroads into their jurisdiction. There is need for the Parliament to think over this issue. The deployment of central forces cannot be suo motu and what needs to be done in this regard is the moot question. We have been struggling with proxy war and this has been a routine feature. Are we in a position to make amends this constitutional provision? I would like to talk only about this constitutional provision that if you deploy army suo motu than such response is conflict with the provisions contained in section 130 Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC). When NIA was constituted, the states had opposed establishment of its offices citing that law and order is a state subject. Today, you expect NIA to be proactive. We are facing proxy war since 1980. We have a 14880 km long international border crossing 92 districts and 17 states. There are several factors prevailing in bordering areas which aggravate our security situation and the attack on Pathankot airbase was also due to these factors. We still have unsettled boundary issues with certain countries. So, we have to deploy our security personnel in all bordering areas. A question was also raised whether the locals, the police personnel or defence personnel had helped the terrorists. The next point is illegal emigration which has changed the demography of these areas. A group of Ministers was constituted under the Kargil Review Committee under which four sub committees were constituted. A sub committee had recommended to review the national security pattern. I want to know from the Government as to what difficulties we have in implementing the recommendations of that group of Ministers consisting of Madhav Godbole Saheb, Arun Singh Saheb, Saxena Saheb and N.N. Bohara Saheb. If the Government is likely to enact a TADA like law or the states will have to enact their own laws. There is a constant demand of coordination in the name of permanent Cabinet committee on security. Will its meetings be held or not?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As the country was celebrating new year, the terrorists were trying to enter the Pathankot airbase to damage it. Cordial relations between India and Pakistan are crucial for peace not only in India but the entire south Asian region. We also want progress of the country and to safeguard the national interests. I agree that political points should not be scored on the issue of terrorism. History shows us that whenever the BJP has come to power and initiated talks with top Pakistani leadership, the country has been betrayed. Facts remain that foreign policy cannot be emotional but it should be strategic. We had a warning 48 hours in advance still we could not foil the attack on Pathankot airbase. In all, there has been a complete lack of coordination. There was no planning for command and control nor any decision could be taken. Operation was on at Pathankot and decisions were being made in Delhi. There was complete lack of political leadership capabilities. When you were in the Opposition, you said that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand but now you are taking U turns every now and then. There have been a number of terrorist incidents during your period still you are talking to Pakistan. You must work for improving relationship but let there be no loss of our security personnel. It is being said that our NSA will depose before Pakistani investigative team but the Government is silent on this issue. The Government should inform the House whether our NSA will depose before the Pakistani team or not. It is also being said that a Pakistani team will visit the Pathankot airbase. Let the House know whether the Pakistanti team will be allowed into the airbase or not. After the Mumbai incident the Government on the basis of a well thought out policy had isolated Pakistan due to which India and Pakistan were no longer equated. But our Prime Minister without informing anyone and without having any set agenda went to Pakistan for chai pe chercha. As a result, the labours of six years were wasted in one stroke. Today, we want answers. We do not want that the lives of our jawans be put at risk in this way. Nor should the country's dignity be compromised. Today, we need to take the country in confidence. We need to think of our nation's interest. If you reach a consensus all the parties will support you. However, if you follow the policy of 'ekla chalo' as is being done now then the Government would find itself in a situation which it faces now.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations should be opposed. At any cost there should not be any security lapse that could threaten the sovereignty of this country. Recently on 2 January 2016, Pakistan terrorists attacked the Pathankot air base. At the end, 8 lives including 7 security personnel and 1 civilian were lost. We also killed six terrorists. Our Officers * Original in Tamil should work efficiently in gathering intelligence inputs. A strong action and scheme is the need of the hour of safeguard our defence establishments and equipment. There should be a strong vigil along the borders including Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab. Whether the lapse in gathering intelligence input has led to Pathankot attack? I want to know that what are the efforts taken by India to isolate Pakistan in world arena. Along with the security forces, our police forces should also be modernized and strengthened. All the States including Tamil Nadu should be provided sufficient funds for strengthening police forces. Like Pakistan, another neighbour Sri Lanka is disturbing us on other side. Indian fishermen who engage in traditional fishing in Pak Bay are time and again apprehended by Sri Lankan Navy along with their fishing boats in the pretext of crossing the International Maritime boundary. Sri Lanka should immediately release 96 Indian fishermen along with their 82 fishing boats and the continuing atrocities against these innocent fishermen should be stopped at any cost.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pathankot airbase was attacked on the early morning of 2nd January, 2016, seven days after our Prime Minister paid an impromptu visit to Shri Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. SSP in that area was kidnapped and he informed the police who informed the top brass that fidayeen have entered the Indian side from across the porous border. On 2nd January, the operations ensued. We lost seven defence personnel. How even after the Dinanagar, Gurdaspur attack on 27th July we did not take sufficient steps to protect the border. How they were able to infiltrate into the Air Force base. Why were no combined operations headquarter set up? These are questions which the Minister must answer if we have to see that there is no recurrence of some such fidayeen attacks in future. When an air force base is directly attacked, you need not even alert the State Government. The Defence forces should take control of the situation. Why did it not happen? What is our Pakistan policy? Does it consist of flip-flops? Then, our Prime Minister made an unscheduled visit. It is weakening the Indian resolve. The main question remains. What was their target? Their targets were two. They wanted to kill 25 Afghan airmen who were under training at Pathankot. Secondly, they wanted to destroy our asset. That is, to attack helicopters and MiG 21 planes. Good luck that didn't happen.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pathankot airbase was attacked on 2nd January, 2016 by six fidayeens from Pakistan. Their aim was to destroy the fighter aircrafts and helicopters and thereby damage India's strategic assets. Our forces gave them a befitting reply. One police officer had informed the security agencies one day before the attack. After this information there was adequate time to deploy the security forces. This did not happen. This police officer of the Punjab police was involved in drugs smuggling. Severe legal actions should be taken against him. Few days after the historical Lahore visit of Hon.Atal Ji, Kargil incident happened. After the attempts of Dr. Manmohan Singh more than 200 people were killed in Mumbai. Hon.Prime Minister went to Pakistan on 25th December and this incident happened on 2nd January. Shiv Sena president hon.Balasaheb Thackrey was always of the opinion that we should not establish friendship with Pakistan. It is not worth our friendship. All the Muslims in Waijapur are with Shiv Sena. SIMI, Indian Mujahideen should be controlled. All efforts should be made for this. Under no circumstances should friendship be established with Pakistan. We should fight them.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

January, 2016 witnessed an infiltration of terrorists into our Pathankot Air Base. I salute all the soldiers who are fighting for the country. I also salute the parents of the soldiers who have scarified their lives. Hon.Defence Minister also admitted that same gaps led to the terror attack on the Air Force Base. Intelligence Bureau and the Punjab State Intelligence had sent out a warning five days ahead of the terrorist attack that ' there was a huge threat to installations on the border with Pakistan'. Before the SP was stopped, the terrorists had already managed to sneak across the International Boundary. Lack of coordination reflected between our command and control. There was no clarity over who was in-charge of the Operation. We are unable to learn lessons despite repeated attacks including the 2008 Mumbai strike. The terrorists aimed to destroy the strategic assets at the 'technical area' and they came near doing it. The terrorists should never have been allowed to climb over the perimeter wall. How could the extremists breach the high walls of the highly protected base when concrete intelligence was available hours in advance? Punjab has been turning as a hub for drug and arms trafficking, money laundering, spying and terrorism. The possible involvement of Central and State Police personnel in these activities must be probed. I strongly feel that the local villagers should be trained and used as effective soldiers. We have to learn lessons from each attack. We should not compromise with our national security. I would also suggest to set up a Joint Force under one umbrella and also to establish a proper command and control system immediately.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a serious issue as this issue relates to the national security. I think it has got two aspects. First, we all will have to speak in one voice about cross border terrorism. Secondly, we should sit together and decide as to how to overcome it, so that the terrorist do not have the courage to sneak into India and attack us. We are also concerned about Indo-Pak relations. Our past experience of two decades about terror attacks suggests that such attacks were bound to happen. We feel that there should be good relations between India and Pakistan but we should keep our border safe also. When our Minister of External Affairs visited Pakistan and comprehensive dialogue resumed, some people across the border tried to derail the process by launching such attacks in our country. The Government should remain firm and the dialogue process should continue. The other point is that the terrorist use the narcotics routes. The lapses have of course taken place and the government has constituted a review committee and its report should be submitted and accordingly curative arrangements should be made. The government should not trust the fake twitter accounts. Rather, the government should depend on its own intelligence sources. The Government should keep the country as well as the youths united. Jawans and youths should also remain together and no attempt should be made to divide them in two blocks.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would salute the Army, NSG and the Punjab police personnel who have been killed in these two terror attacks. Both these attacks - the Gurudaspur attack and the Pathankot attach - have just happened within a gap of six months and both the times, the same mistakes were repeated. We thought some procedures would change. But the same thing has been repeated. Lack of coordination among the Ministries is a greater concern. I would like to know from the Government whether it has filled up those gaps after the attack. I would like to know how many times it has met after the attack. Does the Multi-Agency Centre still exist? I would also like to support that the dialogue with Pakistan should go on.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is an eye opener for us because we are not learning much from the past experiences. The Army, Air Force, Intelligence and the border states like Punjab, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir should have a regular dialogue on these issues. What we see is, the attempt by the terrorists to derail and thwart the peace process which our hon.Prime Minister is very seriously taking up. I do not know why there is a failure of intelligent system every time. We need to improve our intelligent system. Once it is done, we will not have these kinds of incidents.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The brave soldiers of India have always defeated the soldiers of Pakistan but this is a matter of regret that whenever peace dialogue takes place between India and Pakistan then, India looses. The Government had prior intelligence input, still, Pakistani terrorist sneaked into India and launched a terror attack leading to killing of our seven brave soldiers. Therefore, this has to be decided as to who is responsible for all this. I would therefore like to say that the issue of nationalism should not be raised repeatedly. Every citizen of this country is nationalist. As far as the issue of the national security is concern, I would like to say that the whole country is with the government I would also like to say that bilateral dialogue should continue but the dialogue should be on the firm basis and after the dialogue the moral and the dignity of our armed forces should not be affected in any manner. It should not happen that the bilateral dialogue takes place and next day terror attack also takes place. If terror attacks happen even after receiving the intelligence input and our soldiers are killed then those sitting in the government are also responsible for it. SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR: Pakistani terrorists infiltrate into India and spread terrorism so as to split Punjab and Kashmir from India and this is a long story from the year 1947 till Pathankot attack. Today, the need of the hour is as to how to check the nefarious designs of Pakistan. Pathankot attack could have been averted if Indo-Pak border would have been sealed effectively. The responsibility of our border security lies with different organs of the government. Internal security is with the Ministry of Home Affairs, external security with the Ministry of Defense and our diplomacy is handled by the Ministry of External Affairs. I think there is lack of coordination among these three government organs leading to such attacks. This needs to be taken utmost seriously. We should make earnest efforts to have peace dialogue with the civilian government of Pakistan. However, our border and our internal security should be strengthened.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is the utmost duty of every citizen of this country to protect the nation. We have to realize and this nation should take this as a lesson that terrorists have infiltrated in the Pathankot Airbase. Our nation should be alert. We have no intentions to blame anyone in this regard but government should admit that some monumental lapse has taken place and that there are chinks in the armour. So, we have to tackle the terrorism. For this purpose we have to analyze that areas where lapses have taken place such as RADAR system, security system, intelligence system and border security system. We are one in the matter of nation's security. I salute those soldiers who have sacrificed their lives.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First of all, I take this opportunity to salute and also pay my tributes to the brave soldiers who have laid their lives for the safety and security of our country India. As everybody knows, Pathankot airbase is the biggest airbase in India that too in northern India and it is located near India-Pakistan border. Such a very sensitive and strategically important centre being attacked by five or six or eight terrorists and our not being able to counter it within the time as we wish means that it is absolutely an intelligence lapse on the part of the Government. The second issue is the communication lapse. There is no coordination among different Departments of the Government. The specific point which I would like to ask the Government is how many times the Cabinet Committee on Security met during this time? Has the Cabinet Committee on Security met and taken any decision? The third point which I would like to make is that the argument advance by the Government is that vital assets have not been destroyed even after 24 hours of serious terrorist attack. It is shameful for the Government to say nothing has been destroyed. I would like to know from the Government that in order to improve the security apparatus of our country, what are the things the Government has done during the two years after the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack? My final point is regarding the Indo-Pak relationship. We would like to know what is the Pakistan policy of the NDA Government. We would like to ask the Government very specifically, please spell out the Pakistan policy.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pathankot is the most strategical Airbase of our country which is located 20 km away from the border. We have seen frequent terrorist attacks in and around this region. I would like to ask from the Government that why government had resorted to running the operation by bringing in the NSG commandoes from Delhi whereas four different battalions of Military were posted near Pathankot. Moreover, when our Government has intelligence input about the infiltration of terrorists, then why the battalion posted nearby was not sent to provide security of that base? Whether the role of Air Force was not up to the mark in this regard. Why Government is taking so much time to complete the investigations in this regard. I would also like to ask the government to repeal the Section 370. I would also ask for clarification from the government that whether any official has been held responsible for such incident occurred in our country.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to ask for clarification from the government regarding 2-3 points. Why our government has failed to know the numbers of terrorists infiltrated in this country? I would also like to urge upon the government that why the intelligence system in our country is so poor. Government should also provide information that why the intelligence system has failed in this regard. This matter is not only a challenge for this government only but it is also a challenge posed before the whole nation. And the whole nation has accepted this challenge and I am sure that if this government is capable of giving a befitting reply to this challenge then we are with the government. Time has come that we should give them a befitting reply.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My first point is related with nation's security. Keeping in view the nation's security I would like to submit few points. I would like to know from the Government that had they been in the Opposition then whether their love for the country would be different. Now, why so much coldness is there? Through you I would like to know from the Government that whether it is a fact that Defence Minister has stated that a group of officials from Pakistan will not be allowed to enter in India whereas Home Minister is ready to allow them. Whether corroborative evidences will be provided to this group and whether our NIA team is likely to visit Pakistan. Our Government has made an assurance that it would bring reforms in National Security Council and I would also like to know the status regarding complete revamping of modern intelligence. At last, I would ask the Government that by when NSAB is likely to be reorganised because its tenure has already expired in January.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If a man is in sorrow in his house, somehow he lives but if his neighbour is not good and well intentioned then he cannot be happy and live in peace. All our former Prime Ministers have had always tried to maintain good relations with our nehbouring countries and our present Prime Minister is also following the same path. India has a total of 15 thousand km long international boundary and out of which about 5 thousand km border is open. If our borders are open then anyone can intrude into our country. We should make more allocations for our defence budget like other countries. Finally, I would like to say that this entire House is with the Government on the issue of national security. We should not do politics on this issue. We should respect all our religions and treat the whole world as our family only then we can lay a sound foundation of a strong India.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our security forces were fully successful in foiling the terrorist attack at Pathankot. We express our heartfelt gratitude to them for this act of bravery. I would like to congratulate our countrymen for expressing their solidarity in this hour of crisis. We all know that terrorism has no caste or religion. It is duty of our security forces to deal with terrorism and they are doing their duty very appreciably. I appeal to all the Members to rise above the party affiliation and come together on the issue of terrorism because if our country survives we survive and if our country does not survive then how could be survive. SHRI GEORGE BAKER: It is true that our country has always wanted peace and we have proved it ever since Independence. Let us start from China. At that time, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said hindi chini bhai bhai. We wanted friendship. We also have had late Lal Bahadur Shastri who very kindly led us in Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan. He brought a feeling of nationalism. Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee had tried to bring peace with Pakistan. We have always tried it. But what do we face? We faced terrorism. In the end, I would just like to ask this country one thing. Let all of us in this august House walk and get victory in peace.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pathankot has to be taken as a part of asymmetric war. We should realize that this is an attempt wherein the opposition forces never expected to win but wants to create a sort of discord amongst out political leadership and amongst other leadership, including the military leadership so that moral strength of the military leadership gets weakened. The Intelligence build-up cannot be done overnight. Intelligence fell to the political aspirations in the past. I can quote many instances when military intelligence has been sacrificed at the altar of political goals. Once you do this it takes time to build up confidence. This compromise made earlier was probably one of the reasons as to why we are suffering today. The question arises why have terrorists shifted towards Punjab? There is one reason. It is because the security forces have tightened their grip in Jammu & Kashmir. Decision to move the NSG was taken mainly because Pathankot Airbase has Air Force asset and it has about 3000 families staying there. The NSG is trained in urban warfare. Had these terrorists entered the family quarters, it was NSG which would have been required. Army was kept ready. This incident totally took only 43 hours, not three days or four days. My instruction was very clear and there was no pressure of time because if you had trapped them properly, where would they run, and we would eliminate them without losing anyone or capture them. That was also another reason why we took time. An hon.Member compared this terrorist attack with the Paris attack. The Paris attack was a suicide bombing attack and that attack lasted about four hours. What happened after the attack there, emergency was imposed in France. We handled the situation in the normal circumstances. The Pathankot attack was a terrorist attack on an airbase where we managed to control them within 200 metres by 200 metres of area, which was away from the technical area, which was also away from the residential colonies. I think, to make such an issue as a political issue, an issue of debate, is dangerous for the nation's security. We should start treating such terrorist attacks as more of a mini war conducted by our adversaries because they are weak. We have already done the security audit of all the Defence Establishments. I can assure you that the Defence installations are secured.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As far as security of the country is concerned, we cannot point fingers towards any of the government. I do not want to question the intent of any government in securing the country. We need the support of all political parties, people of the country to make this country secure. Whenever, the security of our country has been strengthened the entire country has rallied together irrespective of which party is in power. As far as Pathankot is concerned I would like to say that today we have been able to achieve this success on the front of terrorism only because of the great valour shown by our soldiers. No government can claim to have a foolproof strategy or action plan in combating terrorism. As far as our Pak policy is concerned I would like to answer in a single sentence that we want excellent relations with all our neighbours including Pakistan but it cannot come at the cost of our pride and self respect. It has also been said that the operation lacked close and effective coordination . In this respect I would like to reiterate that the operation had full and effective coordination as desired. However, I would like to repeat that it is not possible for anybody to claim that we have a foolproof action plan or strategy. As far as intelligence sharing is concerned, we do share it with the State Governments and we also shared it with the Punjab Government. As far as security is concerned we have a border which is 558 km long in Punjab which is contiguous to Pakistan. However, 12 km out of it is a riverine border and there are no security forces deployed on this stretch. This gap of 12 km lack any fencing and we are trying to provide technological solutions for it so that no terrorist could enter into Indian territory. This government is working with full intent to secure the Indian borders and it is spending greater amount of money and preparing many other projects. We are trying hard to ensure foolproof security for our borders. I have already said about coordination that Army Unit, Airforce and NSG commando, all three were mobilised and they had had required coordination between them. I would also like to apprise the House that we are conducting a border security audit for the entire country so that we could find loopholes and plug them. The discussion was concluded.
